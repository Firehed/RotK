Beatles~
Yellow Submarine~
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
...
So we sailed unto the Sun
Till we found the Sea of Green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our Yellow Submarine!
...
We all live in a Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine
...
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play 
dum-da-dum  da-dum-dad-um

We all live in a Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine

As we live a life of ease
Every one of us has all we need
Sky of Blue, and Sea of Green
In our Yellow Submarine

We all live in a Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine
