Yellow Submarine~
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed unto the Sun
Till we found the Sea of Green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our Yellow Submarine!
We all live in a Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play 
dum-da-dum  da-dum-dad-um
We all live in a Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine
As we live a life of ease
Every one of us has all we need
Sky of Blue, and Sea of Green
In our Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine, A Yellow Submarine

Your Horroscope for Today~
AQUARIUS!
There's travel in your future when your tongue freezes to the back of a speeding bus
Fill that void in your pathetic life by playing Whack-A-Mole 17 hours a day
PISCES!
Try to aviod any Virgo's or Leo's with the Ebola virus
You are the true lord of the dance, no matter what those idiots at work say
ARIES!
The look on your face will be priceless when you find that 40-Pound watermelon in your colon
Trade toothbrushes with an albino dwarf and give a hickey to Meryl Streep
TAURUS!
You will never find true happiness -- What 'ya gonna do, cry about it?
The stars predict tomorrow you'll wake up, do a bunch of stuff, and then go back to sleep
That's your horroscope for today!  That's your horroscope for today!
That's your horroscope for today!  That's your horroscope for today!
GEMINI!
Your birthday party will be ruined once again by your explosive flatulence
Your love life will rin into trouble when your fiance hurls a javelin through your chest
CANCER!
The position of Jupiter says that you should spend the rest of the week face down in the MUD
Try not to shove a roll of duct tape up your nose while taking your drivers test
LEO!
Now is not a good time to photocopy your butt and staple it to your boss's face (Oh no!)
Eat a bucket of tuna-flavored pudding and wash it down with a gallon of strawberry Qwik
VIRGO!
All Virgo's are extremely friendly and intelligent -- Except for you!
Expect a big surprise today when you wind up with your head impaled on a stick
That's your horroscope for today!  That's your horroscope for today!
That's your horroscope for today!  That's your horroscope for today!
Now you may find it inconcieveable or at the very least a bit unlikely
that the relative position of the planets and the stars could have a special deep significance
or meaning that exclusively applies to only you, but let me give you my assurance that these
forecasts and predictions are all based on solid, scientific, documented evidence, 
so you would have to be some kind of moron not to realize that every single one of them is absolutely true.
Where was I?!
LIBRA!
A big promotion is just around the corner, for someone much more talented that you
Laughter is the very best medicine, remember that when your apendix bursts next week
SCORPIO!
Get ready for an unexpected trip when you fall screaming from an open window
Work a little bit harder on improving your low self-esteem, you stupid freak!
SAGITTARIUS!
All your friends are laughing behind your back... kill them!
Take down all those naked pictures of Ernest Borgnine you've got hanging in your den
CAPRICORN!
The stars say that you're an exciting and wonderful person, but you know they're lying
If I were you, I'd lock my doors and windows and never never never never never leave my house again
That's your horroscope for today!  That's your horroscope for today!
That's your horroscope for today!  That's your horroscope for today!
That's your horroscope for today!

Kryptonite~
I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind,
I left my body laying somewhere in the sands of time,
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon,
I feel there is nothing I can do, yeah
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon,
After all I knew it had to be something to do with you,
I really don稚 mind what happens now and then,
As long as you値l be my friend at the end
If I go crazy then will you still
Call me Superman
If I知 alive and well, will you be there holding my hand
I値l keep you by my side with my superman might
Kryptonite
You called me strong, you called me weak,
But still your secrets I will keep,
You took for granted all the times I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head,
Not for me then you would be dead,
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground,
If I go crazy then will you still
Call me Superman
If I知 alive and well, will you be there holding my hand
I値l keep you by my side with my superman might
Kryptonite
If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman
If I知 alive and well, will you be there holding my hand
I値l keep you by my side with my superhuman might,
Kryptonite... Yeah!!
If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman
If I知 alive and well, will you be there holding my hand
I値l keep you by my side with my superhuman might,
Kryptonite

Kiss Me~
Kiss me, out of the bearded barley, lightly, beside the green green grass. 
Swing swing, swing the spinning step. 
You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress.... 
Ohhh, kiss me, beneath the milky twilight; lead me, out on the moonlit floor.
Lift your open hand; strike up the band and make the fireflies dance -- silver moon sparkling.... 
So kiss me....
Kiss me (kiss me), down by the broken treehouse. 
Swing me (swing me), up on its hanging tire.
Bring bring (bring bring), bring your flowered hat.
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map.
Ohhh, kiss me, beneath the milky twilight; lead me, out on the moonlit floor.
Lift your open hand.
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance -- silver moon sparkling.... 
So kiss me....
Kiss me, beneath the milky twilight.
Lead me, out on the moonlit floor.
Lift your open hand.
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance -- silver moon sparkling.... 
So kiss me.... 
So kiss me.... 
So kiss me.... 
So kiss me....

Breathe~
I can feel the magic floating in the air, being with you gets me that way.
I watch the sunlight dance across your face, And I've... never been this swept away.
All my thoughts just seem to set along the breeze, when I'm lying wrapped up in your arms.
The whole world just fades away and the only thing I hear...is the beating of your heart....
Cause I can feel you breathe, it's washing over me, and suddenly I'm melting into you.
There's nothing left to prove, and Baby, all we need is just to be....
Caught up in the touch, the slow and steady rush.
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be..?
I can feel you breathe...Just breathe.
In a way I know my heart is waking up...as all the walls come tumbling down.
Closer than I've ever felt before, and I know,
and you know there's no need for words right now....
Cause I can feel you breathe, it's washing over me, and suddenly I'm melting into you.
There's nothing left to prove, and Baby, all we need is just to be....
Caught up in the touch, the slow and steady rush. 
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be..?
I can feel you breathe...Just breathe.
Caught up in the touch, the slow and steady rush.
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be..?
I can feel you breathe...Just breathe.
I can feel the magic floating in the air, being with you gets me that way....
