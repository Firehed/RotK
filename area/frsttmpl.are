Before the Arch~
You are before a great arch made of stone that looks pretty old.  A
cobblestone path is here that leads north under the arch.  The sky is very
dark and grey with the clouds swirling around.  You hear loud, rolling
thunder, and you see bright lightning streak through the sky.  It looks VERY
dangerous to go north, but the forest to the south looks peaceful.

Under the Arch~
You are underneath a great arch made of stone.  A cobblestone path leads
south to the forest and north into the Forest Temple area.  The sky is very
dark and grey with clouds swirling around.  You hear loud, rolling thunder,
and you see bright lightning streak through the sky.  Looking north, you see
a great temple with two smaller temples around it.  It looks as though it
used to be beautiful.  However, now it looks treacherous with the stormy
sky, dead plants, and especially with all of those devils running around.
