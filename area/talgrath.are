In the highest of mountains.  In the farthest of lands.  In the corners
of the world.  In a place so far away, only the wizest wanderers know of
such.  In a meadow, leading to the heavens.  Seek here, high and low, far
and wide.  Find the mark where the treasure lies.  Find the key that unlocks
the gate.  In your hand you hold a treasure.  A treasure greater than
diamonds, more powerful than magic, more beautiful than a blooming meadow,
and more secret than the deepest depths of the ocean.  With your mind you
must find the path and unlock the way.  Create your own map with your
imagination, and solve the mysterious puzzle.

the bottom of the mine shaft are two giant guards with razor-sharp pickaxes,
and some sets of silver, glowing eyes that stare at you from the darkness. 
A deep growl is heard from the corner of the site, then a guard mutters the
words, "Rock demon."

from the city is reflected throughout the cavern off of crystals to keep the
area bright.

Crystal Cavern~
As you enter this particular section of the cavern, certain crystals seem
to glow brighter than the rest.  Here, a soft red glow pulses, growing
steadily brighter, then fading once more to near darkness, leaving the edges
of the room just barely visible....  It seems to entice you onwards.

colors.

Crystal Cavern~
A pale aquamarine light fills this room.  Upon closer inspection, you can
see both shades of deep green and sea-blue are interspersed throughout the
crystal structure of the cavern.  The ebb and flow of this soft torquoise
glow creates the feel of an underwater dive....  Dappled sunlight over a
stream, blended with the dark depths of the ocean.  To the South, a steady
white light fills the room, providing a glow visible even from where you
stand.

As you enter this room, you notice the soft white shimmer of light
enfolding you.  No longer the oscillating pulse of colors, but a steady
clear glow, guiding your step.  A faint rainbow of glimmering colors are
still visible to the North, but as far as can be seen surrounding you, the
pure white light holds true.

A steady white light fills the room, emanating from the crystals
surrounding you...  A healing glow.  This illumination lights your way
clearly enough to see that the white brilliance lasts into the surrounding
rooms.  In the center of this cavern flows a small whirlpool....  Its
current swiftly flows about a naturally formed shallow smoothed into the
clear crystal floor.  Perhaps if you wade in a bit...?

say Welcome to the Talagrathian Guards!
~
#17401
say The two main purposes of our clan are to protect the city of Talgrath, and establish justice throughout the realm.  While we support peace, we use force if necessary to ensure the safety of friends, allies, and younger adventurers.
say While in the clan, do not attack other members, and do not attack other people unless approved of by the clan.
say If you are attacked, you have the approval to fight back. say The Guards has three orders in which each member is placed in based on class and desires: Order of Knights, Order of Assassains, and Order of Runemasters.
