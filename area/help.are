-1 ROT~

RoT is a ROM2.4 derived mud, which is originally based on the Merc 1.0 code.
The RoT modifications to the ROM source are copyright 1996-1997 by Russ Walsh.
~
-1 ROM~

ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of 1993,
ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM was up for
a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,
and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under
a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.

Alander's current project is Tesseract, the latest version of the ROM code.
It can be found at hypercube.org 9000.

The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:

Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen

New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen

Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth

Maps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)

Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander

Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world

Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bug reports
    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches

New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the originator
of the ASCII flags used in the zone files

ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code
was written by Seth Scott (the new poofin/poofout), and many contributions
and ideas from the Merc list were used.

The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle (my wife) and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't
have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and
wiznet are largely the results of Gabrielle's ideas.

Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes
to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of
hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

-1 'CHARACTER SEPERATION' SEPERATION~

SEPERATION 'CHARACTER SEPERATION'
Character seperation is a simple rule that we have implemented here on RotK
What is Character Seperation? This is a list of rules that go along with it:

-You are allowed to have up to 1000000 characters. However each and every one
 is seperate. This means that you cannot help your alts in any way. You cannot
 talk about who your alts are. You cannot talk about who everybody is.

-I know we can't catch you on things like E-mail and ICQ but, please it is a
 lot more fun when each charater is seperate and there are no grudges because
 of what another character of your did.

-NO MULTIPLAYING! Multiplaying results in testing of the 'nuke' command. Trust
 me, you wont like it!

-Wait at least five minutes. This means if you have one character that your playing
 as, and you want to play as another, you get off, wait a while so nobody suspects,
 and then get back on. Also if you have one character in a good clan and one in an
 evil can you must wait ten minutes. This cuts down on people asking where every
 body is on the good character, then logging the evil to go kill them all.
~
-1 IMMRANKS~

IMMRANKS-
These are the following immortal rules that mortals must understand:

Implementors (L110)- They can do whatever they want, You will listen to them or
you will not play RotK. The Implementor's main role is creating the world. When
problems break out between immortals the IMPs handle it.

Gods (L107-L109)- They will enforce the rules with whatever they see right, this
can be anything they want. However they cannot make up rules on the spot.
A God's main role is keeping peace within the mortals and re-imbing characters.
Also, gods can run IQuests at will.

Deities (L105-L106)- Deities are generally here for the sole purpose of building.  They
can enforce the rules as well, but are generally 'not here'.

Angels (L102-L104)- Angles are Demi-Gods that are still new to being immortal. They
do NO punishments and mostly help newbies learn how to play RotK. They are STILL
Immortals and deserve the respect of an Implementor.

-1 PLATINUM GOLD SILVER MONEY~

Midgaard's economy is based on platinum, gold and silver coinage (and the
lowly copper, which you as an adventurer are far too proud to carry).
Platinum coins are worth 100 gold coins.  Gold coins are worth 100 silver
coins.  Gems can be bought to alleviate weight problems from the
Midgaard jeweller, he charges a mere 10% more than they are worth.

-1 WolfHistory~

In the beginning there were two.  They stepped forward and thus the realm
came into being.  Birds, rodents, lizards, fish, and wolves, all created in
an instant.  Thus was the beginning.  None dared speak, for none knew their
voice.  The twin deities then stepped back.  All life stood immobile, not
daring to test their bodies, not daring to explore their potential.  Thus
was the first day.  The twin deities stepped forward once more, and night
was created.  Infinite pin points of light contrasted with the pitch black
of the new sky.  A beautiful shining orb lay in the center, and the animals
gazed in awe.  From a jagged outcrop floated a sweet sound.  A lone wolf sat
on the rocks, head lifted towards the new moon, voice resonating beautiful
music across the realm.  Thus was the first night.  The twin deities stared
in amazement at the world they created and the first sound of that realm. 
Their eyes were drawn to the moon howler with the audacity to break the
perfect silence.  Wonder flooded their minds, and the moon howler was
elevated to their inner counsil.  With it the moon howler brought its fellow
wolves, and thus the {*N{7i{*g{7h{*t {$W{4o{$l{4v{$e{4s{0 were born.

~
0 BRIEF COMPACT~

Brief and compact help set your display options for the game. Typing brief
toggles on and off the showing of room descriptions when you move around
(considerably reducing the text to be processed), and typing compact
removes the extra blank line before your prompt.

-1 DEAF~

The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpfull if you are being bombarded
by messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see 'help reply') to
reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you
cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a diety (it's mostly
useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message to
a person).
~
-1 AFK~

Typing AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell
to you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing
recall.  This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes,
but don't want to miss tells.  AFK shows up in your prompt until it is
turned off.

Tells to link-dead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also be
seen by typing replay (unless, of course, the character logs off before
reading them).
~
-1 PROMPT~

Syntax: prompt
Syntax: prompt all
Syntax: prompt build
Syntax: prompt %*

PROMPT with out an argument will turn your prompt on or off.

PROMPT ALL will give you a colorful <hits mana move tnl plat gold silver> prompt.

PROMPT BUILD gives you the [%z][%R][%O][%o] (%e) for a prompt, add color if you wish.

PROMPT %* where the %* are the various variables you may set yourself.

        %h :  Display your current hits
        %H :  Display your maximum hits
        %m :  Display your current mana
        %M :  Display your maximum mana
        %v :  Display your current moves
        %V :  Display your maximum moves
        %x :  Display your current experience
	%X :  Display experience to level
	%p :  Display your platinum held
        %g :  Display your gold held
	%s :  Display your silver held
        %a :  Display your alignment
        %r :  Display the room name you are in
	%e :  Display the exits from the room in NESWDU style
	%c :  Display a carriage return (useful for multi-line prompts)
	%o :  Display the editing mode you are in.  (IMMORTAL ONLY)
	%O :  Display the vnum you are in.  (IMMORTAL ONLY)
        %R :  Display the vnum you are editing (IMMORTAL ONLY)
        %z :  Display the area name you are in (IMMORTAL ONLY)

Example:  PROMPT <%hhp %mm %vmv>
        Will set your prompt to "<100hp 100m 100mv>"

~
-1 ALIGN ALIGNMENT~

Alignment is an expression of your attitudes on life and how you react
to situations. There's good, neutral, and evil alignment. Your alignment
is affected by the alignment of the foes you kill; kill an evil monster
and your alignment shifts towards good, kill a good one, and you head
towards the dark side of things.

Alignment is expressed in numbers from 1000 (pure good) to -1000 (pure evil),
with 0 being true neutral. Most creatures are neither wholly evil nor wholly
good and have alignment scores between 500 and -500. You can check your
alignment by typing SCORE. Spells such as DETECT GOOD, DETECT EVIL, and KNOW
ALIGNMENT will show you the alignment of others.

Alignment affects what equipment you may wear, weapons you may use, how
creatures react to you, experience gained, and, in some cases, what exits
you see.  The Temple of Thoth houses recall for good and high-neutral aligned
characters.  The Temple of Belan is home to those of evil and low-neutral
alignment.  Equipment that is not suited to your alignment will be "zapped"
off of you when you try to wear it. If you are of good alignment, on occasion,
Thoth will protect you from harm in battle (usually from teleport spells),
but Belan, being evil, leaves his followers to fend for themselves.

Should you wish to change your alignment in some way other than fighting
oppositely-aligned foes, you will pay dearly.  Go to the church in Midgaard
near Clan Road and either REPENT ALIGN or CURSE ALIGN at the appropriate
priest for the alignment you wish to become.

-1 MEMBER~

Syntax: member <char>          Invites or removes a member from your clan.
        member <accept|deny>   Accept or Deny an invitation to join a clan.

The first syntax of this command may only be used by the clan leader.
You may not invite a player who is already in another clan.

If you have been invited to join a clan, you may use the ACCEPT option
to actually become a member of that clan.  Use the DENY option if you
do not wish to join the clan in question.
~
0 DEATH~

When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is two-thirds of 
the way back to the beginning of your level.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
Only the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse.

~
0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~

Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set 
amount of experience points for each level based on your creation points.

You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.
~
0 COLOUR COLOR ANSI~

Syntax: colour              Toggles colour mode on/off
        colour list         Lists the available colours and channels
        colour #            Sets your default colour to #
        colour <channel> #  Sets the channel colour to #

Use the list option to view a list of all the channels you can set a color
for, along with the color numbers to use for channels and the default color.

Using a number as the only argument will set your default color to this
number. (Default color is the color most text is displayed in)

Using a channel name as the first argument and a number as the second argument
will set this channels color to the number. for example:
       colour gossip 13
This will change the gossip channel color from the default bright blue to
bright magenta.

You may also talk in colour; the format is like this: the 'escape character'
to specify a colour is the left handed brace '{{', following that you should
use one of the following numbers,

         {x{{0     reset, returns to default

         {r{{1     red     {m{{5     magenta
         {g{{2     green   {c{{6     cyan
         {y{{3     yellow  {w{{7     white
         {b{{4     blue    {D{{8     grey{x

For brighter colours, use the shifted numbers: {R!{G@{Y#{B${M%{C^{W&{x
When using colour, it looks better if you finish the line with whatever
colour it would normally be in, such as a gossip, the colour is magenta, so:
                {mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world{m'{x
        looks better than:
                {mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world'{x

0 COLOURS COLORS~

The following colors are available to be set as either your default, or
on a channel.

     0 - Reset           9 - Bright Red
     1 - Red            10 - Bright Green
     2 - Green          11 - Yellow
     3 - Brown          12 - Bright Blue
     4 - Blue           13 - Bright Magenta
     5 - Magenta        14 - Bright Cyan
     6 - Cyan           15 - Bright White
     7 - White          16 - Black
     8 - Grey           17 - None

The Reset(0) and None(17) options are different depending on how you
are using them.
    If setting your default text color:
       Both 0 and 17 will turn off any default color, reverting back
       to your terminals default color.

0 PET PETS~

You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a time, after 
the old one dies you may purchase a replacement.
~
0 FLAG FLAGS~

The following are the description flags for players and mobiles:
      {x[{yV{DH{cC{bT{wP{CI{rF{BL{@A{*G{&O{$W{RE{YG{WS{GQ{x]
Where:
       {yV{x = Invisible
        {DH{x = Hiding
         {cC{x = Charmed
          {bT{x = Translucent (pass_door)

                      {GQ{x = Quest

The following are the description flags for equiptment:
      {x[{yV{RE{BB{MM{YG{WH{GQ{x]
Where:
       {yV{x = Invisible
        {RE{x = Evil
         {BB{x = Blessed
          {MM{x = Magical
           {YG{x = Glowing
            {WH{x = Humming
             {GQ{x = Quest

You may switch to the old format for flags (as used on other
muds) at any time with the 'long' command.
~
0 LONG~

The LONG command will affect the way you see special flags on other
characters and equipment.  With the long flag set, you will see the
flags much as you do on other muds, most of them as (Aura)'s.
Without the long flag (default), you will see any flags within
a much shorter table.  See 'HELP FLAGS' for the shorter tables.
~
0 TICK~

Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~
0 !~

Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~
0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~

Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~
0 CAST~

Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~
0 EXITS~

Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~
0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~

Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
~
0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~

Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your inventory.
~
0 COMPARE~

Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>
 
COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.
 
COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.
 
COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~
0 FINGER~

Syntax: finger <name>
The finger command will tell you the last time a player logged off
the system.  The entered name must match the players name completely,
and cannot be abbreviated.
~
0 FLEE~

Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.
~
-1 DONATE CDONATE~

Syntax: donate  <object>
        cdonate <object>

The donate command will transfer an object from your inventory to the
donation pit.  If you are a clan member, the cdonate command will donate
the object to your clans donation pit, otherwise, it will work the same
as a normal donate.  Some objects may not be donated, such as quest items,
cursed items, and sub-issue gear.
~
0 EXAMINE LOOK~

Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.
~
0 ORDER~

Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~
0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~

Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.
~
0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~

Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.
~
-1 NOTE NOTES CHANGES NEWS PENALTY IDEA WEDDINGS UNREAD RPNOTES~

The notes on ROT replace the bulletin boards and mail systems found on many
other mud.  The following options are usable:

reading notes:
note list	: show all notes (unread notes are marked with an N)
note read	: either by number, or read next to read unread notes
note remove	: removes a note that you wrote or are the target of
note catchup	: markes all notes as read

writing new notes:
note to		: sets the to line (playername, clanname, immortal, or all)
note subject	: sets the subject for a new note
note +		: adds a line to a new note (i.e. note + hi guys!)
note -		: remove a line from a note in progress
note clear	: erase a note in progress
note show	: shows the note you are working on
note post	: posts a new note. This MUST be done to post a note.
note write      : puts you in an editing mode for the note, make sure parsing
                  is off if you have it, because you need to do .f type things
                  in the editor.

When you log in, you will be informed if there are unread notes waiting. Type
note read to scroll through them one at a time.

Six other note directories exist, these are ideas, rpnotes, news, changes,
weddings, and penalties (gods only).  They are used the exact same way, for
example idea read 5 will read idea #5.  Posting to the news, changes, and
weddings boards is restricted.
The 'unread' command can be used to show your unread notes on all the note
spools.  Also, type 'catchup' to get ALL your note boards marked as read.
~
101 SIGN~

The SIGN command will create a floating sign with your own text.
The main use for this is for creating hint signs during a quest.

sign make	: starts a new sign.
sign + <text>	: adds a line to a sign in progress.
sign -		: remove a line from a sign in progress.
sign clear	: aborts the current sign.
sign show	: shows the sign you are working on.
sign save	: creates the new sign in the current room. (this
		  MUST be done last)
~
0 GOSSIP CGOSSIP QGOSSIP . - = SHOUT YELL~

Syntax: gossip  <message>
Syntax: cgossip <message>
Syntax: qgossip <message>
Syntax: shout   <message>
Syntax: yell    <message>

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

GOSSIP, CGOSSIP, and QGOSSIP are variants of SHOUT (without the delay).
GOSSIP will send the message to everyone listening, CGOSSIP will send
only to those who are clanned, and QGOSSIP will send only to those
who are on a quest.
'.' is a synonym for GOSSIP.
'=' is a synonym for CGOSSIP.
'-' is a synonym for QGOSSIP.

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

Type a channel name by itself to turn it off.
~
0 FORGET REMEMBER~

Syntax: forget   <character>
	remember <character>

Forgetting a player will block out all global messages from that player.
Local messages (say, emote, etc..) will still be visible.

Use either command without an argument for a list of players currently
forgotten.
~
0 EMOTE PMOTE POSE SOCIAL~

Syntax: emote <action>
Syntax: pose

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are
several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK
(type socials or help socials for a listing).

PMOTE is similar to emote, but will substitute you and your for a target's
name (i.e. pmote bonks Alander will be read as bonks you by Alander, and
as bonks Alander by everyone else).

POSE produces a random message depending on your class and level.
~
102 SMOTE~

Syntax: smote <action>

Smote works exactly like pmote, except you must place your name somewhere in
the string, and it will show that string to everyone in the room.
~
0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~

Syntax: hold   <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear   <object>

it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves.  WEAR is for
armor.  WIELD and SECOND are for weapons.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.

Syntax: value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.
When multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where n
is the position of the item in a list of that name.  So if there are two
swords, buy 2.sword will buy the second. If you want to buy multiples of
an item, use an * (buy 5*pie will buy 5 pies).  These can be combined into
(for example) buy 2*2.shield, as long as the * is first.  

LIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
List <name> shows you only objects of that name.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.
~
0 SACRIFICE~

Syntax: sacrifice <object>
Syntax: sacrifice all

~
0 SCROLL~

Syntax: scroll
Syntax: scroll <number>

This command changes the number of lines the mud sends you in a page (the

sizes, or to 0 to disabling paging.
~
0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~

Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

These commands may require an item skill to be succesful, see the help entries
on the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.
~
0 CONSIDER~

Syntax: consider <character>

tell you how much experience you will get.
~
0 FOLLOW GROUP~

Syntax: follow <character>

Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of
your own.
~
0 VISIBLE~

VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~
0 QUIT RENT SAVE~

Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.

Some objects may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game 
you will be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~
0 RECALL /~

Syntax: RECALL

RECALL prays to your god for miraculous transportation from where you are
back to the Temple of Midgaard.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.
If you are a member of a clan that has it's own reincarnation room,
your god will transport you there, unless you have been labeled a thief
or killer.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).  This
chance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% recall does not 
insure success.

RECALL costs 1/4 of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.
~
-1 SPLIT~

Syntax: SPLIT <silver> <gold> <platinum>

SPLIT splits some coins  between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the loot after a kill.  The first argument is the amount of silver
the split (0 is acceptable), the second gold (optional), and the
third platinum (optional).
Examples:
split 30 	--> split 30 silver
split 20 50	--> split 20 silver, 50 gold
split  0 10	--> split 10 gold
split  5  0  10 --> split 5 silver, 10 platinum
~
0 STEAL~

Syntax: STEAL coins <character>
Syntax: STEAL <object> <character>

STEAL attempts to steal coins, or an object, from a character.

There are penalties for using STEAL on other players.

In order to STEAL successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~
0 PRACTICE~

Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum between 80% and 100%,
depending on your class.  You must be at a guild master to practice.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.
~
0 TRAIN~

Syntax: train <str int wis dex con hp mana>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase
mana or hp by 10.  You receive one session per level.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.
~
110 ADVANCE~

Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~
110 TRUST~

Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~
110 WEDPOST~

Syntax: wedpost <character>

WEDPOST sets or removes the wedpost flag on a mortal player.  This flag
allows a mortal to post to the wedding announcement message list.
~
109 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~

Syntax: allow   <site>
	ban     <site> <newbies|all|permit>
	ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.

A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set
by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.
*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or 
content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidently lock out too many
sites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.
~
109 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~

Syntax: reboot
	shutdown

Reboot kills all connections to the MUD, but starts up again quickly.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.
~
108 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~

Syntax: wizlock
	newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to ROT. Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 101), except for link-dead players who
are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically
used for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,
and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the imps.

A god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game.
~
109 DENY WIPE~

Syntax: deny <name>
        wipe <name>

DENY and WIPE lock a character out of a game permanently, rendering their
character name unusable.  They may only be removed by editing the pfile, for
this reason freeze is usually preferred.

If a player is DENY'd, they will be sent a message telling them so, then
will be forced to quit.  They will then recieve a message telling them
they are denyed access any time they try to connect.

If a player is WIPE'd, they will recieve no message, and will be immediatly
disconnected.  They will immediatly be disconnected any time they attempt
to connect, with no explanation.
~
107 DISCONNECT~

Syntax: disconnect <name>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.
~
106 FREEZE~

Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
~
109 DUPE~

Syntax: dupe <character> <name>

DUPE will add or remove a dupe account name to a list kept on the players
account.  Anytime this player connects, all characters on their dupe list
will be forced to quit (except immortals).  This should be used only on
those who flagrantly violate the rule against bringing in more than one
character at a time and using one character to build a second.  Entering
a dupe that is already on the list will cause it to be removed.

Using DUPE <character> without the second argument will list that
characters current dupes.
~
0 QUEST QUESTS~

Certain characters in the game will allow you to go on quests to recover an
item or kill another mob. To go on a quest, you must be in the same room with
a questmaster. When you successfully complete a quest, you will receive a
certain number of quest points. These points may be saved up and used to buy
incredible items from the questmaster.

The QUEST command is used for information about your current quest, to request
a quest from a questmaster, etc. Commands are as follows:

QUEST POINTS - Gives your current number of quest points. This command may be
used anywhere.

QUEST INFO - If you are on a quest, this will remind you who or what you are
after.

QUEST QUIT - This will quit your current quest, although you will not be able
to quest again for 30 minutes.

QUEST TIME - Gives the amount of time remaining on your current quest, or the
amount of time until you can request another quest. This command may be used
anywhere.

QUEST REQUEST - Petitions the questmaster to send you on a quest. If you
accept the quest, you will be given a realtime limit (in minutes) in which you
must complete the quest. If you are on a quest to kill a creature, when you
come across that creature you will see a [TARGET] notice before it. This is
the creature you are to kill.

QUEST COMPLETE - Once you have completed your quest and recovered the item or
killed the mob or whatever, you must return to the questmaster who sent you on
the quest and use this command. If you have successfully completed your quest,
he will reward you with gold and quest points. Once you complete a quest you
cannot request another for 10 minutes.

QUEST LIST - Displays the list of fabulous items for sale by the questmaster.
These items are not buyable via gold, they must be purchased with quest points.

QUEST BUY <item> - Purchases an item from the questmaster and deducts the cost
of the item from your quest points.
~
0 IQUEST~

Syntax: iquest          Turns your iquest flag on.
        iquest <on|off> Imms only, turns global iquest flag on/off.

The iquest flag identifies players participating in a quest.  It also
protects the player during a quest, by making them non-pkill.

The quest flag can only be set when the global quest flag is on, and
can not be turned off until you either quit and relog, or the quest has
been completed.  Upon the completion of the quest, the flag will be
turned off automatically when the global quest flag is removed.

When the global quest flag is on, a message will be displayed at the
bottom of the 'who' list.
~
102 MQUEST MPOINT~

Syntax: mquest <object>
        mpoint <object>

MQUEST sets or removes the quest flag on any object.  A mortal character
may only carry ONE item with the quest flag set.

MPOINT sets or removes the questpoint flag on any object.  Any character
who then uses this object will recieve a quest point.  The questpoint
flag is automatically removed from an object by the system once the
quest point has been given.
~
103 FORCE~

Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.

Below level 107 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is
unavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example.

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~
102 SOCKETS~

Syntax: sockets
	ipcheck
        ipcheck <name>

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including 
users in the process of logging in.
IPcheck is the old version of sockets, less colorful, and far less simple to
understand :(
The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).
~
104 LOAD~

Syntax: load mob <vnum>
	load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to 
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old
format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new
format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.
(see also clone, vnum, stat)
~
104 STRING~

Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
	string mob <field> <string>

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string
mob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.
~
105 NOCHANNEL NOCLAN NOEMOTE NORESTORE NOSHOUT NOTELL NOTITLE~

Syntax: nochannel <character>
	noclan    <character>
	noemote   <character>
	norestore <character>
	noshout   <character>
	notell    <character>
	notitle   <character>

NOEMOTE, NOSHOUT, and NOTELL are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The NOCHANNEL command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music) on the game.
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.

The NORESTORE command makes a player immune to the restore command.
This is used to punish players who constantly ask for restores from
immortals.

The NOCLAN command makes a player unable to join pkill-type clans.
This is used to punish players who are known to cause serious troubles
with pkilling.

The NOTITLE command makes a player unable to set their own title.
This is used to punish players who use the title for swearing,
threats, etc....
~
103 TWIT PARDON~

Syntax: twit   <character>
        pardon <character>

TWIT sets the Twit flag on a player.  When set, the twit flag causes
any mobiles in a LAW room (all of Midgaard) to attack the player,
and the shopkeepers will not sell to the player.  Also, any player may
attack and kill a player with the twit flag, whether they can normally
pkill or not.

PARDON will remove the Twit flag if set.
~
102 PURGE~

Syntax: purge
	purge <character>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag
set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Hassan).  Mobiles may be
purged if they are called directly by name.
~
106 RESTORE~

Syntax: restore <character>
	restore room
	restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.
~
107 SLAY~

Syntax: slay <character>

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use this
command on players if you enjoy being a god.
~
104 TRANSFER TELEPORT~

Syntax: transfer <character>
	transfer all
	transfer <character> <location>
	transfer all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all 
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer. 
~
102 RECOVER~

Syntax: recover <character>

Recover transfers the target character to their default recall point.
You may only recover a character who is either cursed, or is stuck in
a no-recall area.
~
104 AT~

Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).
~
102 ECHO GECHO PECHO~

Syntax: echo  <message>
	gecho <message>
	pecho <character> <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level
god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it
is an echo.
~
102 GOTO~

Syntax: goto
        goto <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

Goto with no argument will take you to your default location if you
have one set. (see GSET)  If used in this manner, your pet will be
transfered with you.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
god level.

Implementors can use the violate command to get into private rooms.
~
102 GSET~

Syntax: gset <vnum>

Gset allows you to set the default location for the goto command to
take you to.
~
102 HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS~

Syntax: holylight
	wiznvis <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will mke you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 110 characters are totally 
invisible.
~
102 INCOGNITO GHOST~

Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the
room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you.
Toggling your ghost status will do the exact opposite, making you invisible
to anyone in the same room as you, but visible to those outside the room.
While ghost is set, you will still appear visible to all characters in the
game through the 'who' command. (depending on your wizinv level)
Both take a level argument similar to wizinvis, people at that level
or higher can see you regarless of location.
These flags are mutually exclusive, turning on one will automatically turn
the other off.
~
102 MEMORY~

Syntax: memory

Memory reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.
~
102 VNUM~

Syntax: vnum <name>
	vnum <obj or mob> <name>
	vnum skill <name>
	vnum area

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name. Vnum area lists
all areas and their range of vnums.
(see also load)
~
102 STAT~

Syntax: stat <name>
	stat mob  <name>
	stat obj  <name>
	stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room 
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.
(see also goto, transfer)
~
102 MWHERE~

Syntax: mwhere <name>

Mwhere shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name.
~

102 POOFIN POOFOUT INVISIN INVISOUT~

Syntax: poofin  <message>
Syntax: pooffout <message>
Syntax: invisin <message>
Syntax: invisout <message>

The standard messages for goto are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and
'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.  Poofin and poofout only
show to characters who can see you.

Invisin and Invisout are the same thing, except it is for when you go wizi, and
does not nessecarily have to include your name.
~
109 PROTECT~

Syntax: protect <character>

Protect is used to protect a character from unwanted snooping.  Removing 
protected status from a character WILL be seen by that character.
~
105 LOG SNOOP~

Syntax: log   <character>
	log   all
	snoop <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to the implementors.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you are an IMP.

Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time. Try to respect privacy.

Snoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
~
103 SWITCH RETURN~

switch into link-dead PCs.

Return returns you to your original body.
~
102 IMMTALK :~

Syntax: immtalk <message>
	immtalk

Immtalk sends a message to all immortals.  : is a synonym for immtalk.

turns it back on).
~
-1 WIZNET~

Syntax: wiznet 
	wiznet show
	wiznet status
	wiznet <field>

Wiznet is sort of an immortal news service, to show important events to
the wiznetted immortal.  Wiznet by itself turns wiznet on and off, 
wiznet show lists all settable flags (they are not detailed here), 
wiznet status shows your current wiznet settings, and wiznet <field> toggles
a field on and off.  The events should be self-explanatory, if they are not,
fiddle with them a while.  More events are available at higher levels.

Syntax: cast 'cure poison' <character>

This spell cures poison in one so unfortunate.
~
0 'CURE LIGHT' 'CURE SERIOUS' 'CURE CRITICAL' HEAL~

Syntax: cast 'cure light'    <character>
Syntax: cast 'cure serious'  <character>
Syntax: cast 'cure critical' <character>
Syntax: cast 'heal'          <character>

These spells cure damage on the target character.  The higher-level spells
heal more damage.

(see 'help healer' for details on the heal command)
~
0 CURSE~

Syntax: cast 'curse' <character>

This spell reduces the character's to-hit roll and save versus spells.
It also renders the character unclean in the eyes of the gods and
unable to RECALL. Curse may be used to fill equipment with evil power,
allowing (for example) weapons to do more damage to particularly holy
opponents.
~
0 'DETECT EVIL'~

Syntax: cast 'detect evil'

This spell enables the caster to detect evil characters, which will
reveal a characteristic red aura.
~
0 'DETECT HIDDEN'~

Syntax: cast 'detect hidden'

This spell enables the caster to detect hidden creatures.
~
0 'DETECT INVIS'~

Syntax: cast 'detect invis'

This spell enables the caster to detect invisible objects and characters.
~
0 'DETECT MAGIC'~

{YSPELL:{W Dispel Evil                        {YGROUP:{W Attack
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
 
{wSyntax: cast 'dispel evil' <victim>{x
 
This spell invokes the wrath of the gods on an evil victim. It can be
very dangerous for casters who are not pure of heart.
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
~
0 'DISPEL MAGIC' CANCELLATION~

Syntax: cast 'dispel magic' <character>
        cast 'cancellation' <characte>
 
Both of these spells remove magical effects from the target.  Dispel magic
has a reduced chance of working, and is considering an attack spell.
Cancellation can only be used on allies, but is much more effective and does
not provoke attack.  Unfortunately, the spells do not discriminate between
harmful and benign spells.
 
The chance of dispelling is based on the level of the spell. Permanent spells
(such as mobile sanctuary) are much harder to remove.  Not all spells may
be dispelled, notable examples are poison and plague.
~
-1 EARTHQUAKE~

{YSPELL: {WEarthquake                             {YGROUP:{W Attack
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
 
{wSyntax: cast 'earthquake'{x

Beware that other characters who are not yet fighting may attack
you as a result!

{YSPELL:{W Empower                             {YGROUP:{W Creation{x
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
Syntax: cast empower <spell>
 
This spell magically binds another spell to either a scroll, or a
potion, depending on the type of spell being bound.  This spell
can be quite costly in terms of mana, since not only does it use
mana for this spell, but also for the spell being bound.
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
~
0 'ENCHANT WEAPON'~

Syntax: cast 'enchant weapon' <weapon>

This spell magically enchants a weapon, increasing its to-hit and to-dam
bonuses by one or two points.  Multiple enchants may be cast, but as the
weapon grows more and more powerful, it is more likely to be drained or
destroyed by the magic.  Also, every successful enchant increases the level
of the weapon by one...and there is no turning back.
~
-1 'ENCHANT ARMOR'~

The enchant armor spell imbues armor with powerful protective magics. It is
not nearly as reliable as enchant weapon, being far more prone to destructive
effects.  Each succesful enchant increases the plus of the armor by 1 or 2
points, and raises its level by one.
~
0 'ENERGY DRAIN'~

Syntax: cast 'energy drain' <victim>

This spell saps the experience points, mana, and movement points of its
target.

{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x

will become visible when they attack. It may also be cast on an object
to render the object invisible.

including the caster.

{YSPELL:{W Pass Door                        {YGROUP:{W Transportation
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
 
{wSyntax: cast 'pass door'{x
 
This spell enables the caster to pass through closed doors.
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
 
~
0 POISON~

Syntax: cast poison <victim>
Syntax: cast poison <object>

This spell reduces the strength of the victim by two, as well as reducing the
victim's regeneration rate. It may also be used to poison food, drink, or
a weapon in a fashion similar to envenom ('help envenom'), but with 
drastically reduced effectiveness.
~
0 RESURRECT~

Syntax: cast resurrect

This spell will resurrect the first corpse in the room it finds, turning
it into a zombie.  Zombies are considered pets, and cannot be created if
you already have a pet.
~
0 ANIMATE~

Syntax: cast animate <object>

This spell will reanimate dead body parts from your inventory into charmed
mobiles.  These are not considered pets, so there is no limit to the
number of body parts you can animate.
~
0 CONJURE~

Syntax: cast conjure

This spell will conjure up a powerful pet demon.  As pets, a demon cannot
be conjured if you already have a pet.  The conjure spell requires a
special source of power to be used, similar to the portal and nexus
spells, though not the same source.
~
0 VOODOO~

Syntax: cast voodoo
        voodoo <pin|trip|throw>

The voodoo spell will turn a sliced-off body part of a PC character into
a voodoo doll.  Hold the body part in your hand when casting.

The voodoo command can be used to inflict pain, trip, or throw another
player accross the room (or sometimes out of the room).  Hold the
voodoo doll in your hand when using the command.

Voodoo dolls in your name can be destroyed with the help of the priests
in the church, but at a hefty price.

After the successful use of a voodoo doll, your victim will be immune to
the effects of another use for 1 tick.

{RWARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING{x
Having a voodoo doll in your inventory makes you vulnerable to
{RPKILL{x by the victim of the curse, with {RNO{x restrictions
of level, tier, or clan affiliation.
Because of this, you cannot give a voodoo doll to another person,
or use the transport spell on a doll, they must pick it up of thier
own free will.  If you pick up your own voodoo doll, it will soon
vanish.
~
0 SANCTUARY 'IMPROVED SANCTUARY'~

Syntax: cast sanctuary  <character>
Syntax: cast 'improved sanctuary'

The SANCTUARY spell reduces the damage taken by the character from any attack

0 VENTRILOQUATE~

Syntax: cast ventriloquate <speaker> <message>

This spell throws your voice, making it appear that some other object or
character in the room is saying your message.  Victims who make their saving
throw will know that someone is using ventriloquism, but not who.  Victims who
fail their saving throw will think that the object or character really did say
your message.
~
0 WEAKEN~

Syntax: cast weaken <victim>

~
-1 'WORD OF RECALL'~

-1 'ACID BREATH' 'FIRE BREATH' 'FROST BREATH' 'GAS BREATH' 'LIGHTNING BREATH'~

Syntax: cast 'fire breath'      <victim>
Syntax: cast 'frost breath'     <victim>

damage one victim, whereas gas damages every PC in the room.  Fire and
frost can break objects, and acid can damage armor.

High level mages may learn and cast these spells as well.
~
-1 IMMORTAL IMMORT GOD~

'Immortal' (often, simply, 'immort') refers to players who have reached
the highest attainable levels in the game.  Here, anyone of level 102
or higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the
usual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;
examples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to
creation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,
ability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote
players to immortality.

Since immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)
a carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal
behavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without
explicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please
don't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or
you'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to
this file.

The duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,
are topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are
fraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)

{^Welcome {#S{3t{#a{3f{#f {3o{#f {#K{3e{#e{3p{#e{3r{#S{!!

{xYou are responsible for following the laws of immortal behavior.

* Type 'help laws' for the rules you are expected to follow as an Imm.
* Type 'help jobs' to get some idea of what you should be doing.

~
102 JOBS~

This is a list of what a god of any given level should be doing. It is
not complete yet.

New builders: (102)
If you want to become a full-fledged builder, show us what you have!

Questors:     (103)
Your main job is to run miniquests for the mortals, but don't go too
crazy with the prizes, mainly just give out QPs.

Divinities:   (104)
You are basically like peacekeepers, but not as severe.

Builders:     (105)
Build! Build! Build!  Basically, leave the mortals alone for the most
part, answer questions if they have it, but all you really need to do
is build, usually while wizi.  Note: Don't attack new mobs! (That goes
for anyone)

Clan Leaders: (106)
Run your clan.  Don't member everyone in sight, let them approach you.
First tier they need to be level 25, second tier 15, and third tier,
any level is fine.

Peacekeepers: (107)
Name says it all: Keep the peace!  Peacekeepers enforce the rules (even
though any immortal really can).  You would mainly be the people who do
NOCHANNEL type punishments, and cornering.  Illegal EQ confiscation is
OK too.  You can now corner <char> # so they serve their corner time
and not have to worry about an immortal being on to let them out.  They
get transferred to the Quest Shop when they are done.  Talk to the IMPs
if a character is repeatedly being a jerk, and needs deletion.

Head Questor: (108)
Tekino, thanks for your work on Talagrath, have fun with it as you
please!

Head Builder: (109)
Make sure that no immortal is making insanely good areas, level 16000
mobs, etc.  You build as well, but you really are here to keep track of
the other builders.

Implementors  (110)
You put this place here, you know what to do! *cackle*

{! ******************************************************************{x
{! * Cheating for your mortal is bad, severe punishments (aka NUKE) *{x
{! * Having a test mortal is OK, just has to have 'test' somewhere  *{x
{! * in the name, if you have a mortal that you actually play, do   *{x
{! * NOT affect him/her in any way!                                 *{x

Player killing and player stealing are allowed to all persons, provided the
victim is is within the range of the character.

.
              ****************************************
              ** The Rules of Realms of the Keepers **
              ****************************************

1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.
    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.

2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own.
    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,
    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,
    and softening up or altering mobs.

3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.
    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly
    go there themselves.

4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.

5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.  You cannot reboot
    to avoid a MUD-crash because of the OLC-24hr bug, because it was fixed.

6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie
    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items
    isn't.

7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT
    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some
    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels
    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 hero potions).
    Also, if you can find it in the shop in Firehed's office, it
{R    IS NOT{x to be given out for any reason (except the matches,
    or marbles for the Keepers of Fire).

8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.

9)  Do not try to overrule each other.

10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal
    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.

~
-1 RULES~

These are the rules of RotK.  For other matters, use common sense.
For clan specific rules, see {WHELP CLANRULES.{x
 
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
 
Do not backtalk to the immortals.
 
Do not harass another player. (spamming in tells, etc).
 
Any character can attack any other character in their range. (Type 
   range in game)  Also, any character can steal from anyone in their 
   range. (See above)  These ranges EXCLUDE members of your own clan
   if you are in a clan. 
 
If you get PKilled or PStealed, don't complain to the imms, because
   all they can do is say 'Get your clannies to help you out.'  Also,
   be careful, because even those unclanned are PKill-able.
 
Your presence here is a privilege not a right. Obey any orders from
   gods, and you will be fine. Deletion does not require a reason,
   appeals are to be sent to the implementors.
 
If your corpse gets lost in a crash, and you can verify it with a log
   that your eqipment was lost, and what you had, we will reimburse you for
   any items lost.  Note that if you are simply unable to retrieve your
   corpse, that is your own problem.

WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE in public areas and channels.
 
Absolutely no advertising for another MUD, under ANY circumstances.

No MULTIPLE logins, multiple playing, or helping your own
   characters with other characters you own -- by any arrangment.
   This means that you cannot affect your alts in ANY way.  No EQ
   sharing, etc.  See the HELP SEPERATION helpfile.
 
No kill stealing. This means you cannot attack a mob someone else
    is fighting, unless they ask you to. Also avoid attacking fleeing
    mobs.  Killing the PLAYER is fine, just not the mob.
 
If you get pkilled, you will *NOT* be reimbursed ANY eq by the IMMs;
   this includes edited EQ, items of sentimental value, quest items, etc.

Cheating will not be tolerated. This includes accepting favors from
    gods and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not
    use it.  ALSO: DO NOT ASK IMMORTALS FOR FAVORS. 'Nuff said.  (This
    does NOT include spellups for clanned characters while the immortal
    is in the clan's recall room.)
 
Changes to these rules are at the discretion of the immortals, and
    may be done without warning, notice, or even evidence of sanity.

{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
~
-1 CLANRULES~

Do NOT join any clan until you investigate ALL clans.

If you get pkilled, you ask your CLAN MATES to retrieve your corpse,
   re-equip you, help you avenge your death, etc. Do not count on the
   IMMs for help, as it is against the immortal laws.

Clanned characters are *not* allowed to pkill anyone in their own clan.

If you are a clan leader, you are expected to MUD on a regular basis.
   If you do not actively play your character for three weeks, and have not
   found a replacement, you will be removed as leader.

If you are in a clan, your alignment must follow your clan's alignment.
   This means that you cannot go walking arounds with an align of 1000 in an
   evil clan.  You will be reminded once if nessecary, but once is all.
   Continuing to keep an inapropriate align can result in punishment.  Your clan
   should have a mob where you can repent/curse your align appropriately.

As a member of a clan, you are expected to assist other members of your
   clan. This includes spellups, corpse retrievals, levelling, etc.  If you need
   to contact an immortal because one of your clannies isn't fulfilling their
   duty, make sure that you have contacted your clan mates, and clan leader first.

If you join a clan, you are stuck with that clan for the rest of the
   life of the character.  You may reroll out of your clan, but you cannot
   just leave and switch to a new clan, which is quite illegal.  So if
   you want out, you have to reroll.
~
0 REROLL~

The reroll command may be used once you reach hero status in the first
tier of classes, or at any time while playing a second tier character.
This command must be typed twice to reroll a character, and you cannot
be forced to reroll.  Typing reroll with an argument will return your
character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the first reroll.

After typing reroll the second time, you will be forced to quit.  When
you reconnect, you will have to re-create your character, but will be
given the second tier classes to choose from, instead of the first tier
classes. (see 'help tier')

After rerolling, you will start out in your new class at level 1, so
this command is similar to deleting and recreating your character.
 
The same type of process works for third tier.  If you reroll when you
are in third tier, you will be given the list of third tier classes
again.
~
-1 TIER~

{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
 
                               {YTIER{x
 
There are currently twenty-four classes in RotK, split into three tiers.
   1st tier classes:       2nd tier classes:       3rd tier classes:
 
   {RM{rage                    {BW{bizard                  {GA{grchMage
   {RC{rleric                  {BP{briest                  {GA{grchBishop
   {RT{rhief                   {BM{bercenary               {GA{gssassin
   {RW{rarrior                 {BG{bladiator               {GB{garbarian
   {RR{ranger                  {BS{btrider                 {GP{gathfinder
   {RD{rruid                   {BS{bage                    {GH{gierophant
   {RV{rampire                 {BL{bich                    {GN{gecromancer
   {RC{ronjurer                {BE{blementalist            {GA{gncient
 
{GThe second tier classes are notably stronger than the first tier
classes, as are the third to the first but you cannot create a
character in these classes until you reach the hero level in a class
of the prior tier. (see 'help reroll')
 
{GYou DO NOT have to choose the second tier class or third tier class
that is in the same slot as the first tier class, ie: a mage does
not have to become a wizard, wizard not an archmage, you are given
the option of choosing any of the classes.
 
{GBecause of the strength difference between the tiers, player killing
and player stealing is forbidden between the tiers.
 
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
~
0 HEALER~

The healer decided to grab a quick buck, and now charges for his heals.  Some
services are still free to players of level 30 or below, however.  To see
a full listing of the healer's services, type 'heal' at his residence. To
receive healing, bring plenty of money, and type 'heal <spell>'.
~
-1 GAIN~

The gain command is used to learn new skills, once the proper trainer has
been found. (Check New Thalos) The following options can be used with gain:

gain list:    list all groups and skills that can be learned
gain points:  lower your creation points by 1 (costs two sessions)
gain <name>:  add a skill or skill group, at the listed cost
gain convert: turns 6 practices into one training session
gain study:   turns 1 training session into 6 practices

Gain uses training sessions, not practices. (see 'help train')
Gained skills and groups do NOT increase your experience per level or total
number of creation points. 
~
-1 RESTRING~

Syntax: restring obj <string>

The restring command is used to change the name of an object in your
inventory.  Only specific trainers have the ability to restring an object
for you (Check New Thalos), and charge you 50 quest points per item.

Restringing an object will only change the short name of the object, not
the long description or keywords associated with that object, so you will
still have to use the original keywords to use a restrung object.

For example:
    Object to be restrung is 'an imperial sword',

       > restring sword a battle axe

    This will now show up as 'a battle axe' in your inventory, and will use
    this string in actions:  '<char> wields a battle axe' or '<char> gets a
    battle axe'.

    Because the keywords of the object are not changed, to wield or
    manipulate this object, you will still need to use 'sword' or 'imperial',
    ie:  get sword     wield sword
~
102 CLONE~

Syntax:
  clone obj <object>
  clone mob <mobile>
  clone <name>

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile
that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in
the same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or
mobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  
Strung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.
~
110 RANDCLAN~

Syntax: randclan

Randclan will move the entrances to all clan halls to new randomly selected
locations.  This is automatically done by the system at boot, and once per
day thereafter, but can be called by an implementor to correct any problems
in the choice of locations from the last automatic run.
~
0 SKILLS SPELLS~

The skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list
of available skills (or spells, as the case may be).  They are listed in
order of level, with mana cost (for spells) or percentage (for skills)
listed where applicable.
~
0 OUTFIT~

The outfit command, usable by levels 9 and below, equips your character with
a new set of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet, shield, and vest), 
courtesy of the Mayor's warehouses.  Only empty equipment slots are affected.
~
0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT AUTOSTORE AUTOPEEK AUTOALL~

ROT uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting
gold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:

autoall   : turns all of the auto's on <-- {YNew!{0
autolist  : list all automatic actions
autoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles
autogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles
autosac	  : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)
autoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room
autosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members
autoassist: makes you help group members in combat
autostore : saves all tells during combat
autopeek  : will show inventory during a look <char> (with the peek skill)

Typing a command sets the action , typing it again removes it. 
~
-1 CLAN~

A Clan is a collection of players, united to follow and further
a common cause.  Each clan has rules and regulations, to find out
more about clans and their 'beliefs' type "help <clan name>".  To
join a Clan you must be level 25 or above.  Second tier players
may join a clan starting at level 15.  Third tier players can join
at any level.  Speak to the Clan Leader about joining.  If you go
Loner you may join a Clan later, unless you are loner by punishment.

A list of current clans can be obtained with:  clan list
~
-1 COUNT~

The count command displays the number of people (that you can see) logged
into the mud.  It also displays the highest number observed that day, if
it is higher.
~
-1 GATE~

{YSPELL: {WGate                           {YGROUP: {WTransportation
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
 
{wSyntax: cast gate <target>{x
 
Casting gate will instantly transport the caster to the location of
the target mob or person. It is very difficult to gate to a mob much
higher in level than oneself, and characters with nosummon on cannot
be gated to at all.
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
~
-1 AFFECTS AFFECT~

This command is used to show all the spells affecting your character. At
low levels, only the spell name will be displayed, at higher levels the
effects and duration of the spell will also be shown.  Spell effects
are no longer shown on score (this can be changed by using 'show' command).

|  Halfelves are a cross between a human and an elf, usually   |

|  powerful. Unfortunately they are also more bitter, and      |
|  much more aloof than either the most secretive elf or the   |

|  The draconians are a fearsome race, and almost as secre-    |

|  any other race though, draconians are not mammalian. They   |
|  more closely resemble lizards, snakes, and especially       |
|  dragons. Draconians are very strong, and tougher even than  |
|  dwarves. Unlike most races that reach such large            |
|  proportions, they retain a keen mind, and make good mages   |
|  as well as warriors.                                        |

-1 WANDS STAVES SCROLLS~

Magical items require training to use properly.  If your character lacks the
necessary skill to use an item, he will fail, possibly destroying it.  The
item skills are as follows:

scrolls		The reading of magical scrolls and books (see 'help recite')
staves		The use of staves and similar devices (see 'help brandish')
wands		The use of wands and similar items (see 'help zap') 
~
-1 'GROUP HEADER'~

The following skills and groups are available to your character:
~
-1 'GROUP HELP'~

The following commands are available:
list         display all groups and skills not yet bought
learned      show all groups and skills bought 
premise      brief explanation of creation points and skill groups
add <name>   buy a skill or group
drop <name>  discard a skill or group

-1 'GROUPS' 'INFO' 'PREMISE'~

The ROT skill system allows you to fully customize your new character, making
him or her skilled in the skills you choose.  But beware, the skills you pick
at character creation are the only skills you will ever learn.  Skills are 
paid for with creation points, and the more creation points you have, the
harder it is to gain a level.  Furthermore, higher-cost skills are harder to
practice.

Skill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or spells
that are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.  There is a 
default skill group for each class, which can be selected for a balanced 
selection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.

The experience breakdown is as follows: 
points   exp/level     points   exp/level
40        1000         90        6000
50        1500         100       8000
60	  2000         110      12000
70        3000         120      16000 
80        4000         130      24000
The table continues in a similar manner for higher point totals.
~
-1 'CLASS'~

Syntax:  class
         class all
         class <group>

Typing class by itself will list all spell groups that you currently have.
The [class all] format will list all groups that are available to your
particular class.  The [class <group>] method will list all of the spells
available to your class within that group, along with the level at which
you recieve the spell.
~
-1 BASICS 'ROT BASICS'~

The basic skills:

Every character starts with two skill groups, one for their class and a default
set that all characters receive.  The default skills are:

recall  	essential escape skill (see help recall)
scrolls		reading of scrolls and other magical volumes
staves		use of magical staves
wands		use of magical wands

for class defaults, check the classes themselves.

-1 EXOTIC WEAPONS WEAPON WEAPONSMASTER AXE DAGGER FLAIL MACE POLEARM SPEAR SWORD WHIP~

Each weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines how
well a character fights with a particular weapon.  The weaponsmaster group
provides talent in all weapons (save exotics), from chair legs to halberds.
If the character has the parry skill as well, he can parry incoming attacks.
The chance of parrying is best if the character in question is skilled at 
both his weapon and his opponent's.

The weapon skills consist of the following:

weaponsmaster	skill group of all weapons listed below (save exotic weaponry)
axe		the use of axes, ranging from hand to great (but not halberds)
dagger		the use of knives and daggers, and other stabbing weapons
flail		skill in ball-and-chain type weapons
mace		this skill includes clubs and hammers as well as maces
polearm		the use of pole weapons (except spears), including halberds
spear		this skill covers both spears and staves, but not polearms
sword		the warrior's standby, from rapier to claymore
whip		the use of whips, chains, and bullwhips
exotic		the use of strange magical weapons

The exotic skill cannot be purchased, and is dependent solely upon level.

{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
 
{wSyntax: cast transport <object> <char>{x
 
This spell will transport an obj from your inventory to the inventory
of another player. You can turn off the ability to recieve transports
using the notran command.
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
~
-1 'SHIELD BLOCK'~

Shield block is a rather fancy name for the art of parrying with a shield.
Characters with no shield block skill will not be able to defend themselves
well with a shield.  All classes may learn shield block, but only warriors and
clerics are good at it.  Beware, flails ignore shield blocking attempts, and
whips have an easier time getting around them.  Axes may split shields in two.
~
-1 'ATTACK'~

{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
                              {YATTACK{x
 
The attack spells are essentially powerful curses, fueled by divine
energy rather than magical power (like the combat spells are). They
are less powerful than the combat spells, but can still deal out a
stinging blow. Mages and thieves cannot use this group. The attack
spell group consists of the following spells:
 
{rdemonfire       a powerful, but very evil, spell
{wdispel evil     torments evil foes
{Ydispel good     calls down unholy power on good creatures
{yearthquake      brings the power of earth to bear against your foes
{Rflamestrike     sends a column of flame from the heavens
{Mheat metal      heats metal equipment to searing temperatures
{Cray of truth    sends forth a blinding ray of holy energy
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
~
-1 BEGUILING~

This insideous spell group is used to invade the minds of others.  It consists
of various charming magics, well suited for turning your foes to your cause.
Only mages and thieves have access to the beguiling magics, which consist of
the following:

animate		gives life to severed body parts
calm            if successful, stops all fighting in the room
charm person	turns an enemy into a trusted friend
resurrect	resurrects corpses, making them your pet
sleep		puts a foe into enchanted slumber

-1 COMBAT~

These sorcerous spells are, in the words of one famous mage, just 'more ways to
toss energy around'.  They are the most powerful of the damaging spells, and
considered an essential part of most wizards' collections. Clerics and thieves
do not have access to these spells.  In order of power, the combat spell group
contains the following magics:

magic missile	send a weak energy bolt into a foe
chill touch	weakens your enemy with a frigid grasp
burning hands	sends a blast of fire into your foe
shocking grasp	sends a powerful jolt into a foe
lightning bolt	sends forth a single bolt of lightning into an enemy
colour spray	blasts your opponent with a rainbow spray, which may blind him
fireball	a powerful spell, great for burning your enemy to ashes
acid blast	sends forth a stream of acid to eradicate your foes
chain lightning	sends lightning bolts arcing through foes 
~
-1 CREATION~

{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
                             {YCREATION{x
 
The creation spell group is used to create objects, of temporary or
permanent duration. Skill creators can travel without food or drink,
and use their powers to create nourishment as required. All classes
may become learned in this group, which contains these spells:
 
{Ycontinual light   : creates an eternal light source{x
{ycreate food       : produces a nourishing mushroom{x
{rcreate rose       : creates a beautiful red rose{x
{Ccreate spring     : calls forth a small spring from the ground{x

                    for hauling treasure{x
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
~
-1 CURATIVE~

The curative spells are used to heal various unpleasant conditions that can
befall an adventurer.   For healing of damage, see the healing spell group.
Curative spells cannot be used by mages or thieves.

cure blindness	restored sight to the blind
cure disease	heals the plague
cure poison	removes the harmful effects of poison
~
-1 DETECTION~

The detection spells have may uses, all related to gathering information. They
can be used to see hidden objects, give information about treasure, or even
scry out the true nature of your foe.  All classes except warriors can use 
detection spells.

detect evil	reveals the aura of evil monsters
detect good	similar to above, only for good monsters
detect hidden	shows the whereabouts of hidden foes
detect invis	allows the caster to see the unseeable
detect magic	reveals magical auras to the caster
detect poison	determines if food is safe to eat
farsight	searches for living beings near the caster
identify	gives information about the nature of an object
know alignment	determines the moral character of a monster or person
locate object	finds a specific item
~
-1 DRACONIAN~

The Draconian spell group deals with the magic of dragons -- in this case, 
bringing forth the devastating power of their breath weapons upon your foes.
Only mages have the mental training necessary to cast these spells, and few
of them ever reach the level of mastery required to use them.

acid breath	 uses the black dragon's attack upon an enemy
fire breath	 calls forth the flames of a red dragon
frost breath	 drains the life from a foe with the power a white dragon
gas breath	 suffocates your enemies with poison gas
lightning breath summons the electrical fury of a blue dragon 
~
-1 ENCHANTMENT~

The enchantment spell group is used to imbue items with magical properties.
Currently, this spell group consists of enchant weapon and enchant armor, 
although more will be added in the future.  Only mages may enchant.

enchant weapon	increases the hit and damage bonuses of a weapon
enchant armor	increases the protective value of armor
fireproof       shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid
recharge	restores power to a depleted wand or staff
~
-1 ENHANCEMENT~

The enhancement spells improve upon the body's potential, allowing feats of
superhuman strength and speed.  However, these spells may often have harmful
effects upon the recipient.

giant strength	grants increased strength
haste		doubles the speed of the target, but slows down healing
infravision	allows monsters to be seen in the dark
refresh		restores energy to tired adventurers
~
-1 HARMFUL~

This spell group is the opposite of healing.  The harmful spells are designed
to tear flesh from bone, rupture arteries, and generally turn the body against
itself.  Only priests and warriors may use this spell group.
In order of power, the harmful spells are:

cause light	inflicts minor wounds on an enemy
cause serious	inflicts wounds on a foe
cause critical  causes major damage to the target
harm		the most deadly harmful spell
~
-1 HEALING~

The healing spells are used to cure the wounds that adventurers inevitably
suffer in battle.  For curing other conditions, such as poison, see the
curative spell group.  Only warriors and priests have access to this group.
In order of power, the healing spells are:

cure light	heals minor wounds
refresh		restores vigor to a tired adventurer
cure serious	heals wounds
cure critical	closes all but the worst wounds
heal		the most powerful healing spell
mass healing	casts a heal spell on each player in the room
~
-1 ILLUSION~

The illusions spells are dedicated to deception and trickery.  They can be
used to mask appearances, or create distractions for the party.  Currently,
the illusion group is very small, but it will be expanded in the future.
Only thieves and mages can cast illusion spells, which consist of the 
following:

invis		turns the target invisible
mass invis	turns the caster's group invisible
ventriloquate	allows the caster to put words in someone's mouth
~
-1 MALADICTIONS~

Maladictions are a group of curses and other baneful spells, designed to
cripple, inconvenience, or torture, rather than kill outright.  These spells
may be cast by any class.

blindess	strikes the target blind
curse		prevents recalling and weakens the target in combat
energy drain	drains experience and mana, while strengthening the caster
plague		causes the target to suffer a slow, painful death from plague
poison		weaker than plague, but often fatal
slow		slows your enemies down, reducing their rate of attack	
weaken		drains the strength of the target
~
-1 'PROTECTIVE'~

{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
                             {YPROTECTIVE{x
 
The protective spells are used to shield against harm, whether from
spells or physical attack. They range from the weak armor spell to
the sought-after sanctuary charm. Also included in this group are
several spells for dispeling hostile magics. Any class may use this
group, which consists of the following spells:
 
{Barmor           :provides the target with an extra layer of defense
{Ccancellation    :a powerful dispel, used for removing spells from friends
{wdispel magic    :removes spells from enemies, not as effective as cancel
{rfireproof       :shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid
{Mprotection evil :provides defense from the attacks of evil creatures
{Yprotection good :protects from the attacks of good beings
{wsanctuary       :reduces all damage taken by the recipient by half
{cshield          :puts a shimmering shield between you and your enemies
{ystoneskin       :turns skin hard as stone, providing a huge armor boost
{Gimproved {Wsanc   :reduces all damage taken by 3/4
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x

{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
                               {YSHIELDING{X
 
There are several shields that can be cast, and these are not just any
shields.  These shields actually do damage when the creature affected by
them takes physical damage.
 
{Ciceshield    :an icy barrier which freezes the opponent
{Rfireshield   :a fiery barrier which burns the opponent
{Bshockshield  :a shield of pure electricity which does shocking damage
{Gacidshield   :an acidic bubble will burn the opponent with acid damage
{Dglassshield  :a rough glass ball which slashes the opponent
{Bwatershield  :a water bubble which can drown your foe
{Wholyshield   :a barrier made of pure good can strike down those of evil

~
-1 'TRANSPORTATION'~

{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
                           {YTRANSPORTATION{X
 
The transportation group is used for travel, whether by flight,
magical teleportation, or walking through walls. All classes may
learn these spells, which are among the most useful in the game.
 
{Cfly             : allows the target to fly over nearly all obstacles
{Wgate            : transports the caster to the target
{Mnexus           : forms a two-way portal to a far off destination
{wpass door       : allows the caster to walk through walls
{bportal          : creates a one-way portal to a destination
{Gsummon          : transports the target to the caster
{Bteleport        : sends the target to a random location
{ctransport       : sends the target object to another player
{Yword of recall  : transports the caster to safety in Midgaard
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
~
-1 WEATHER~

These spells allow the caster to manipulate local weather conditions, as well
as summon fog clouds, lightning, or even electrical glows.  This group is
usable by all classes.

call lightning	summons a huge bolt from the heavens, if the weather is right
control weather	changes the weather in the manner desired by the caster
faerie fire	surrounds the target in a glowing aura
faerie fog	reveals all hidden creatures in the room
lightning bolt	sends a bolt of electricity into the target

(the weather command, unrelated to this group, shows local weather conditions)
~
-1 BACKSTAB~

Backstab is the favored attack of  thieves, murderers, and other rogues.  It 
can be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing weapons.
The damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker's level, his
weapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of his opponent.
Only thieves may learn the backstab.
~
-1 BASH~

The bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock
your foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the
bash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon
is not generally a wise idea.
~
-1 BERSERK~

Only powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage
in combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge
surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  
Berserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.
~
-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~

Consider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever 
combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The
blindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity
helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  Only warriors and thieves may
learn this skill.
~
-1 DISARM~

Disarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your
opponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you
are skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon. Only talented thieves
and warriors may learn this skill.
~
-1 DODGE~

In the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not
be where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the
character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the 
target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the
attacker and the target.  Any class may learn dodging.
~
-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~

Warriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that they are
able to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked
for with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus
is very low indeed.
~
-1 ENVENOM~

The envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves, designed to
win a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.
Or, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.
Food, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned
food or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to
be more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could
drink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on
the other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison 
burns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates 
quickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.
~
-1 'HAND TO HAND'~

Hand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning this
style of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.
Trained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.
Clerics and warriors are the best at this skill, although thieves and mages
may also learn it.
~
-1 KICK~

Kicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful
kick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.  Fighters
and clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although thieves may also learn
it.
~
-1 PARRY~

If at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting 
attacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for
full success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced
damage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the
defender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.
~
-1 RESCUE~

A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with
the rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede
in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the
favor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as
well as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and
the target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)
~
-1 TRIP~

Back by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves
using any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.
Tripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will
find the attack easy to avoid.  Thieves and warriors may learn trip.
~
-1 'SECOND ATTACK'~

{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
                          {YSECOND ATTACK{x
 
Training in second attack allows the character a chance at additional
strikes in combat -- allow a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2
attacks every round. Any class may learn this skill, although clerics
and mages have a very hard time with it.
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
~
-1 'THIRD ATTACK'~

{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
                           {YTHIRD ATTACK{x
 
Training in third attack allows the character a chance at an additio-
nal strike in a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack
as well. Perfect third attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.
Only warriors, rangers and highly skilled thieves may learn this skill.
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
~
-1 'FOURTH ATTACK'~

{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
                            {YFOURTH ATTACK{x
 
Training in the fourth attack skill allows the user the chance at
performing four strikes in combat. However, a skill level of 100%
does not guarantee four hits, but it will increase the chances of
at least 3 attacks.
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
~
-1 'FIFTH ATTACK'~

{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
                             {YFIFTH ATTACK{x
 
The most advanced of the multiple attack techniques, fifth attack
allows a chance at landing 5 strikes in a single round of combat.
While a skill rating of 100% does not assure 5 hits, it will in-
crease the chances of getting a fourth attack. Only warriors and
highly skilled rangers may learn this skill.
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
~
-1 HIDE SNEAK~

Hide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.
Hide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the
character remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to
sneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  Only warriors and
thieves may learn these skills.
~
-1 'FAST HEALING'~

The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,
or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general 
toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is 
possible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but mages find it
very difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.
~
-1 LORE~

Lore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use
of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,
concerning its power and uses.  It also may occasionally increase the value
of an object, because more will be known about its worth.  All classes may
learn lore, although thieves are best at it, and warriors find it very hard
to use.
~
-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~

Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to
match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,
or to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are 
already very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best 
guard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling, 
although other classes may learn it as well.
~
0 PEEK~

Peek is both a skill and a command.

The peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,
the better to use the steal command with.

Syntax: peek <char>
This will attempt to peek at a characters inventory, you may also make
this automatic during a: look <char>  by turning on AUTOPEEK.
~
-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~

Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain
access to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  
intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may
learn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.
~
-1 'MEDITATION'~

This skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and
mantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.
Thieves and warriors, with their troubled minds and violent attitudes, have
much trouble learning to meditate.
~
-1 STEAL~

Theft is the defining skill of the thief, and is only available to that class.
It allows items to be stolen from the inventory of monsters and characters,
and even from shops!  But beware, shop keepers gaurd their merchandise 
carefully, and attempting to steal from a character earns you a THIEF flag
if you are caught (making you free game for killing).
~
-1 'DETECT GOOD'~

Syntax: cast 'detect good'
 
This spell enables the caster to detect good characters, which will
reveal a characteristic golden aura.
~
-1 'DISPEL GOOD'~

{YSPELL: {WDispel Good                            {YGROUP:{W Attack
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
 
{wSyntax: cast 'dispel good' <victim>{x
 
Dispel good brings forth evil energies that inflict horrific torment
on the pure of heart. Good-aligned characters use this dark magic at
their peril.
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
~
-1 'RECHARGE'~

Syntax: cast 'recharge' <item>

The recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.
Fully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell
is proportional to the number of charges used.  Magic items can only be
recharged one time successfully.

{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
 
{wSyntax: cast 'demonfire' <target>{x
 
Demonfire is a spell of blackest evil, and as such can only be used by
those who follow the paths of darkness.  It conjures forth demonic
spirits to inflict terrible wounds on the enemies of the caster.

{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
 
{wSyntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target>{x
 
Ray of truth opens a portal to the planes of positive energy, bringing
forth a beam of light of sufficient purity to harm or annihilate the
servants of evil. It cannot harm the pure of heart, and will turn and
strike casters who are tainted by evil.

-1 'PORTAL'~

{YSPELL:{W Portal                         {YGROUP: {WTransportation
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
 
{wSyntax: cast 'portal' <target>{x
 
The portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way
portal to the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.
Portals are entered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'go portal'.
Portals cannot be made to certain destinations, nor used to escape
from gate-proof rooms. Portal requires a special source of power to
be used, unfortunately the secret of this material component has
been lost...

-1 'NEXUS'~

{YSPELL: {WNexus                         {YGROUP: {WTransportation
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
 
{wSyntax: cast 'nexus' <target>{x
 
This spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with
the only difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a
nexus spell makes a two-sided gate. It also lasts longer than the
lower-powered portal spell. Both spells require an additional power
source, the secret of which has been lost...

~
-1 'HEAT METAL'~

{YSPELL:{W Heat Metal                          {YGROUP: {WAttack
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
 
{wSyntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>{x
 
Heat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary
according to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment
(assumed to be all weapons and armor at this point in time) on the
target, causing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious
burns in the process (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to
remove easily). This spell does no damage to creatures who are immune
to fire.
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
~
-1 'HOLY WORD'~

{YSPELL: {WHoly Word                         {YGROUP: {WBenedictions{x 
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
Syntax: cast 'holy word'
 
Holy word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god,
with disasterous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with
powerful blessings on the priest's allies. All creatures of like
alignment in the room are blessed and filled with righteous divine
wrath, while those of opposite morals (or both good and evil in the
case of neutral priests) are struck down by holy (or unholy might)
and cursed. The cleric suffers greatly from the strain of this spell,
being left unable to move and drained of vitality. Experience loss
is no longer associated with the spell.
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
~
-1 FRENZY~

{YSPELL:{W Frenzy                             {YGROUP: {WBenedictions{x        
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
Syntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>
 
The frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly
increasing his or her attack skill and damaging capacity.
Unfortunately, this divine wrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore
threats to personal safety, making the character easier to hit.
Frenzy provides immunity to the calm spell (see 'help calm'), and may
only be used on those of the caster's alignment.
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
~
-1 CALM~

{YSPELL: {WCalm                              {YGROUP: {WBenedictions{x 
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
Syntax: cast 'calm' 
 
One of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master
cleric is the calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a
room. Calmed creatures will not attack of their own volition, and
are at a disadvantage in combat as long as the spell soothes their
minds. The more violence activity there is in a room, the harder the
spell, and it is all or nothing - either all combat in the room is
ended (exception of those who are immune to magic) or none is.
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
~
-1 HASTE~

Syntax: cast 'haste' <target>

The haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing
an extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive
abilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the system,
such that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating
the slow spell. (see 'help slow').
~
-1 SLOW~

Syntax: cast 'slow' <target>

Despite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell
with it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,
it slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate
of attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and halve healing
rates, due to reduced metabolism.
~
-1 PLAGUE~

Syntax: cast 'plague' <target>

The plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,
sapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to
death.  It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like
wildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area.
~
-1 'CREATE ROSE'~

{YSPELL:{W Create Rose                        {YGROUP:{W Creation{x
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
Syntax: cast 'create rose'
 
 
A romantic spell that creates a fragrant red rose, with utterly no
game use whatsoever.
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
 
~
-1 SLIST 'SKILL LIST' 'SPELL LIST'~

Syntax: slist <class>
Syntax: slist <skill/spell>

The SLIST command shows either the skills/spells that a class gains, or
which class and at what level the skill or spell is gained.  When it is
skill specific, the Wait-Time is given in pulses, and there are 12 pulses
to one round of battle.
~
-1 'PROTECTION GOOD' 'PROTECTION EVIL'~

Syntax: cast 'protection evil' <target>
	cast 'protection good' <target>

The protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate
ethos, and improve saving throws against all forms of magic. They may not
be cast on others, and one person cannot carry both defenses at the same
time.
~
0 'GIANT STRENGTH'~

Syntax: cast 'giant strength' <character>
 
This spell increases the strength of the target character.
~
-1 'CHAIN LIGHTNING'~

Syntax : cast 'chain lightning' <target>

Chain lightning is a deadly spell, producing a powerful bolt of lightning
that arcs from target to target in the room, until its force is fully
expended.  Allies of the caster may be hit by this spell if they are members 
of a clan, while the caster himself will not be struck unless no other
viable target remains.  Chain lightning is most effective when used on
groups of creatures.
~
-1 SCAN FARSIGHT~

Syntax: scan
	scan <direction>
	cast 'farsight'

The scan command allows the user to detect movement in surrounding areas.

The farsight spell expands the caster's consciousness, allowing him or her
to see far away beings like they were in the same room.  It takes intense
concentration, often leaving the caster helpless for several minutes.
The spell may be used for a general scan that reaches a short distance in
all directions, or with a directional component to see creatures much
farther away.
~
-1 MASS HEALING~

Syntax: cast 'mass healing' 

The mass healing spell, as its name might suggest, performs a healing spell
on all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell for good
measure.
~
-1 'FLOATING DISC'~

{YSPELL:{W Floating Disc                     {YGROUP:{W Creation{x
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
Syntax: cast 'floating disc'
 
This useful spell creates a floating field of force which follows the
caster around, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear
of weight penalties. It lasts no more than twice the casters level in
hours, and usually less. It can hold 10 pounds per level of the
caster, with a maximum of five pounds per item. The spell requires an
open float location on the character, and the only way to remove the
disc is to die or allow it to run out of energy.
{R%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%{x
~
-1 FIREPROOF~

Syntax: cast 'fireproof' <object>

The fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,
to protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected
by this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.
Although inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical
for protecting large numbers of objects.
~
-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~

Syntax: alias
	alias <word>
	alias <word> <substitution>
	unalias <word>

The alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,
aliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command.
Alias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the alias with 
that name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and argument 
produces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new
command.  Examples of use:

alias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing 'get all corpse'
alias ff cast 'fireball' --> ff orc will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc'

Only the first word on the line will be subsituted at this time.

2.3 by Hans Birkeland (Hugin). Port to Rom 2.4 by Ivan Toledo (ver 1.5a).

     Inside an editor, typing COMMANDS lists working commands and ? gives

RESET alone will display the resets in the current room.  The <number> will
be displayed with this list.  Typing ? WEAR-LOC will list possible locations
that an object can be loaded to.  The [<max #>] is the maximum number of
mobiles allowed in this room and will default to 1 if no number is entered.

For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical order.
For example if you are equiping a mobile don't load a container in the room
and fill it with some objects and then continue equiping the mobile.  It is
likely that resets will backfire if they are not carefully entered.

If you wish to reset the room then use EDIT ROOM RESET.

These values are 10 times what you would put in an area file. This
is because the server multiplies what it reads from file with 10.

-1 ROT~

RoT is a ROM2.4 derived mud, which is originally based on the Merc 1.0 code.
The RoT modifications to the ROM source are copyright 1996-1997 by Russ Walsh.
~
-1 ROM~

ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of 1993,
ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM was up for
a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,
and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under
a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.

Alander's current project is Tesseract, the latest version of the ROM code.
It can be found at hypercube.org 9000.

The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:

Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen

New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen

Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth

Maps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)

Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander

Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world

Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bug reports
    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches

New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the originator
of the ASCII flags used in the zone files

ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code
was written by Seth Scott (the new poofin/poofout), and many contributions
and ideas from the Merc list were used.

The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle (my wife) and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't
have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and
wiznet are largely the results of Gabrielle's ideas.

Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes
to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of
hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

(my apologies if anyone was forgotten in this list)
~
-1 IMMORTAL IMMORT GOD~

'Immortal' (often, simply, 'immort') refers to players who have reached
the highest attainable levels in the game.  Here, anyone of level 102
or higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the
usual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;
examples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to
creation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,
ability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote
players to immortality.

Since immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)
a carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal
behavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without
explicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please
don't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or
you'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to
this file.

The duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,
are topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are
fraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)

{xYou are responsible for following the laws of immortal behavior.

* Type 'help laws' for the rules you are expected to follow as an Imm.
* Type 'help jobs' to get some idea of what you should be doing.

~
102 JOBS~

This is a partial list of what a god of any given level should be doing. It is
not complete yet.

New builders: (102)
If you want to become a full-fledged builder, show us what you have!

Questors:     (103)
Your main job is to run miniquests for the mortals, but don't go too
crazy with the prizes, mainly just give out QPs.

Divinities:   (104)
You are basically like peacekeepers, but not as severe.
Builders:     (105)
Build! Build! Build!  Basically, leave the mortals alone for the most
part, answer questions if they have it, but all you really need to do
is build, usually while wizi.  Note: Don't attack new mobs! (That goes
for anyone)

Clan Leaders: (106)
Run your clan.  Don't member everyone in sight, let them approach you.
First tier they need to be level 25, second tier 15, and third tier,
any level is fine.

Peacekeepers: (107)
Name says it all: Keep the peace!  Peacekeepers enforce the rules (even
though any immortal really can).  You would mainly be the people who do
NOCHANNEL type punishments, and cornering.  Illegal EQ confiscation is
OK too.  You can now corner <char> # so they serve their corner time
and not have to worry about an immortal being on to let them out.  They
get transferred to the Quest Shop when they are done.  Talk to the IMPs
if a character is repeatedly being a 
jerk, and needs deletion.

Head Questor: (108)
Tekino, thanks for your work on Talagrath, have fun with it as you
please!

Head Builder: (109)
Make sure that no immortal is making insanely good areas, level 16000
mobs, etc.  You build as well, but you really are here to keep track of
the other builders.

Implementors  (110)
You put this place here, you know what to do! *cackle*

{! ******************************************************************{x
{! * Cheating for your mortal is bad, severe punishments... or NUKE *{x
{! * Having a test mortal is OK, just has to have 'test' somewhere  *{x

victim is is within 10 levels of the character.

              ****************************************
              ** The Rules of Realms of the Keepers **
              ****************************************

1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.
    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.

2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own.
    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,
    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,
    and softening up or altering mobs.

3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.
    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly
    go there themselves.

4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.

5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.
    * One exception: Reboot may be used by an Non-IMP ONLY for the sake
    * of not crashing the mud after attacking a mob that would be new.
    --->{z{!Quests ONLY{0<---

6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie
    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items
    isn't.

7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT
    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some
    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels
    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).

8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.

9)  Do not try to overrule each other.

10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal
    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.

~
-1 RULES~

These are the rules of RotK.  For other matters, use common sense.
For clan specific rules, see HELP CLANRULES.

* A member of a clan may kill a member of any other clan.

* A member of a clan may steal from a member of any other clan.

* If you join a clan, and someone either pkills you, or psteals from you,
  do not complain to the gods, or ask the gods to return your eq or do
  a corpse retrieval for you, as they are forbidden from doing so.

* Your presence here is a privilege not a right. Obey any orders from gods,
  and you will be fine.  Deletion does not require a reason, appeals are to
  be sent to the implementors.

* Watch your language in public areas and channels.

* No multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with
  other characters you own -- by any arrangment.

* No kill stealing.  This means you cannot attack a mob someone else is
  fighting, unless they ask you to. Also avoid attacking fleeing mobs.

* Cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods
  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.

* Changes to these rules are at the discretion of the immortals, and may be
  done without warning, notice, or even evidence of sanity. 
~
-1 CLANRULES~

1. Do NOT join any clan until you investigate ALL clans.

2  If you get pkilled, you ask your CLAN MATES to retrieve your corpse,
re-equip you, help you avenge your death, etc. Do not count on the
IMMs for help,. as it is against the laws.

3. Clanned characters are *not* allowed to pkill anyone in their own clan.

4. If you get pkilled, you will *NOT* be reimbursed ANY eq by the IMMs;
this includes edited EQ, items of sentimental value, quest items, etc.

5. If your corpse gets lost in a crash, and you can verify it with a log
that your eqipment was lost, and what you had, we will reimburse you for
any items lost.  Note that if you are simply unable to retrieve your 
corpse, that is your own problem.  See 5 below.

6. Clanned characters are not allowed to ask for or receive ANY kind of
IMM-related help; this includes corpse retrievals, spellups, assistance
locating chars, reimbursements, etc, unless rule 5 comes into effect.

7. If you are a clan leader, you are expected to MUD on a regular basis.
If you do not actively play your character for three weeks, and have not
found a replacement, you will be removed as leader.

8. If you are in a clan, your alignment must follow your clan's alignment.
This means that you cannot go walking arounds with an align of 1000 in an
evil clan.  You will be reminded once if nessecary, but once is all.
Continuing to keep an inapropriate align can result in punishment.  Your clan
should have a mob where you can repent/curse your aling appropriately.

9. As a member of a clan, you are expected to assist other members of your
clan. This includes spellups, corpse retrievals, levelling, etc.

0 SUICIDE DELETE~

Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,
and you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will
return your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the
first delete.  Second tier players should use reroll to recreate a
character, instead of the delete command.
~
0 REROLL~

The reroll command may be used once you reach hero status in the first
tier of classes, or at any time while playing a second tier character.
This command must be typed twice to reroll a character, and you cannot
be forced to reroll.  Typing reroll with an argument will return your
character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the first reroll.

After typing reroll the second time, you will be forced to quit.  When
you reconnect, you will have to re-create your character, but will be
given the second tier classes to choose from, instead of the first tier
classes. (see 'help tier')

After rerolling, you will start out in your new class at level 1, so
this command is similar to deleting and recreating your character.
~
0 TIER~

There are currently fourteen classes in ROT, split into two tiers.
1st tier classes:
   {RM{rage    {RC{rleric  {RT{rhief      {RW{rarrior    {RR{ranger   {RD{rruid  {RV{rampire{x
2nd tier classes:
   {BW{bizard  {BP{briest  {BM{bercenary  {BG{bladiator  {BS{btrider  {BS{bage   {BL{bich{x

The second tier classes are notably stronger than the first tier
classes, but you cannot create a character in these classes until
you reach the hero level in a first tier class. (see 'help reroll')

You DO NOT have to choose the second tier class that is in the same
slot as the first tier class, ie: a mage does not have to become
a wizard, you are given the option of choosing any of the classes.

Because of the strength difference between the tiers, player killing
and player stealing is forbidden between the tiers.
~
0 HEALER~

The healer decided to grab a quick buck, and now charges for his heals.  Some
services are still free to players of level 30 or below, however.  To see
a full listing of the healer's services, type 'heal' at his residence. To
receive healing, bring plenty of money, and type 'heal <spell>'.
~
-1 GAIN~

The gain command is used to learn new skills, once the proper trainer has
been found. (Check New Thalos) The following options can be used with gain:

gain list:    list all groups and skills that can be learned
gain points:  lower your creation points by 1 (costs two sessions)
gain <name>:  add a skill or skill group, at the listed cost
gain convert: turns 6 practices into one training session
gain study:   turns 1 training session into 6 practices

Gain uses training sessions, not practices. (see 'help train')
Gained skills and groups do NOT increase your experience per level or total
number of creation points. 
~
-1 RESTRING~

Syntax: restring obj <string>

The restring command is used to change the name of an object in your
inventory.  Only specific trainers have the ability to restring an object
for you (Check New Thalos), and charge you 50 quest points per item.

Restringing an object will only change the short name of the object, not
the long description or keywords associated with that object, so you will
still have to use the original keywords to use a restrung object.

For example:
    Object to be restrung is 'an imperial sword',

       > restring sword a battle axe

    This will now show up as 'a battle axe' in your inventory, and will use
    this string in actions:  '<char> wields a battle axe' or '<char> gets a
    battle axe'.

    Because the keywords of the object are not changed, to wield or
    manipulate this object, you will still need to use 'sword' or 'imperial',
    ie:  get sword     wield sword
~
102 CLONE~

Syntax:
  clone obj <object>
  clone mob <mobile>
  clone <name>

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile
that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in
the same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or
mobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  
Strung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.
~
110 RANDCLAN~

Syntax: randclan

Randclan will move the entrances to all clan halls to new randomly selected
locations.  This is automatically done by the system at boot, and once per
day thereafter, but can be called by an implementor to correct any problems
in the choice of locations from the last automatic run.
~
0 SKILLS SPELLS~

The skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list
of available skills (or spells, as the case may be).  They are listed in
order of level, with mana cost (for spells) or percentage (for skills)
listed where applicable.
~
0 OUTFIT~

The outfit command, usable by levels 9 and below, equips your character with
a new set of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet, shield, and vest), 
courtesy of the Mayor's warehouses.  Only empty equipment slots are affected.
~
0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT AUTOSTORE AUTOPEEK~

ROT uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting
gold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:

autoall   : turns all of the auto's on <-- {YNew!{0
autolist  : list all automatic actions
autoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles
autogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles
autosac	  : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)
autoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room
autosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members
autoassist: makes you help group members in combat
autostore : saves all tells during combat
autopeek  : will show inventory during a look <char> (with the peek skill)

Typing a command sets the action , typing it again removes it. 
~
-1 CLAN~

A Clan is a collection of players, united to follow and further
a common cause.  Each clan has rules and regulations, to find out
more about clans and their 'beliefs' type "help <clan name>".  To
join a Clan you must be level 25 or above.  Second tier players
may join a clan starting at level 15.  Speak to the Clan
Leader about joining.  If you go Loner you may join a Clan later.

   New Clans may be formed by writing a note to the immortals.
Please remember that their word is final on all matters not covered by
this help.

A list of current clans can be obtained with:  clan list
~
-1 COUNT~

The count command displays the number of people (that you can see) logged
into the mud.  It also displays the highest number observed that day, if
it is higher.
~
-1 GATE~

The gate spell is a powerful transportation magic that opens up a portal
between your character and another person or creature somewhere else in the
world.  This portal will transport you and any pet you might have, but not
other members of your group.  Monsters recieve a save against gate, and
monster or players more than 3 levels higher than you can not be gated to at
all.  God rooms, private rooms, and no recall rooms cannot be gated to, and
no recall rooms cannot be gated out of.  Finally, any god or hero is also
immune to gate, as well as any player who has no summon set.  Clan members
may not be gated to except by their fellow Clan members.
~
-1 AFFECTS AFFECT~

This command is used to show all the spells affecting your character. At
low levels, only the spell name will be displayed, at higher levels the
effects and duration of the spell will also be shown.  Spell effects
are no longer shown on score (this can be changed by using 'show' command).
~
-1 'RACE HELP' 'RACE' 'RACES'~

ROT has the following races for player characters:
  Human      the standard race
  Dwarf      good warriors and clerics, cost 8 creation points
  Elf        good thieves and mages, cost 5 creation points
  Giant      huge, tough warriors, cost 6 creation points
  Pixie      good mages and druids, cost 6 creation points
  Halfling   very adept thieves and mages, cost 5 creation points
  HalfOrc    good warriors, cost 6 creation points
  Goblin     good thieves and vampires, cost 5 creation points
  HalfElf    good rangers or druids, cost 2 creation points
  Avian      good druids or clerics, cost 5 creation points
  Gnome      natural mages, cost 4 creation points
  Draconian  good mages and warriors, cost 11 creation points

Different races have different starting statistics, and also different
stat maximums for magic items and training.

Creation points increase the amount of experience it takes to gain a level.
For more information, see the help files for each race (i.e. 'help dwarf')
~
-1 ROOMS~

Clan Room may be bought using cubic zirconiums, see 'help prices'
for a list of the prices.  Only one clan room within an organization
may be set as a healing room. The price quoted for the mana/heal option
will set BOTH up to 200%, which is the max.
Likewise, a clan may only have 1 healer, who will be reset into the main
clan room.

Healers are the same FOR ALL CLANS, so DO NOT ask that
your healers prices be lowered, or that it give out free spells to
higher level players!

Only clan leaders may make a request for additional rooms, etc...
What we need from you when you request a clan item:
    Mobiles:
            Job of the Mobile (healer/store keeper/practice dummy/etc.)
            Name of the mobile
            Description of the mobile
    Rooms:
            Name of room
            A full description of the room

Clans with a large number of rooms will be given consideration for having
more than one entrance to thier area in different areas of the realms.

Any mail not following the guidlines above will be tossed in the trash.
~
-1 KEEPERS~

[{RCLAN{x]

or another clan leader.
~
-1 BROTHERHOOD~

[{RCLAN{x]

[{RCLAN{x]
No help currently available for Mercenaries.
~
-1 DWARF DWARVES~

Dwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great
stamina.  Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity.
They are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long 
lifespans.  Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests, but are very poor
mages or thieves.  

Dwarves are very resistant to poison and disease, but cannot swim, and so
are very vulnerable to drowning.  They recieve the berserk skill for free
(if warriors), and can see in the dark with infravision.
~
-1 ELF ELVES~

Elves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build.  They
lack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are far more agile,
both in body and mind.  Elves are superb mages and thieves, but have at
best fair talent as warriors or priests.

Elves resist charm spells most effectively, due to their magical nature.
However, they are burned by the touch of iron, and so are barred from the
use of iron or steel in their adventuring careers.  Elves are notoriously 
hard to spot, and so elven warriors and thieves recieve the sneak and hiding
automatically. They may see in the dark with infravision.
~
-1 HUMAN HUMANS MAN~

Humans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of
adventurers. Although they have no special talents like the other races,
they are more versatile, being skilled in all four classes. Humans may
also train their primary stat higher than any other race, and are able to
gain more benefit from magical devices.
~
-1 GIANT GIANTS~

Giants are the largest of the races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They
are stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  
They aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy
than the other races.  Giants make the best warriors of any race, but are
ill-suited for any other profession.

Giants resist heat and cold with nary a mark, due to their huge mass.  However,
their slow minds make them extremely vulnerable to mental attacks.  Giants,
due to their size and stamina, receive the fast healing and bash skills for
free. (Only giant warriors recive bash).
~
-1 PIXIE PIXIES~

Pixies are very much like the elves...and share with them a vulnerability
to iron weapons.  They also share the nature-loving attitude and peaceful
demeanor, but beyond this pixies reach an extreme.  They are extremely
magical creatures which, unlike elves, fly everywhere they go.  Their
wings are fairly redundant, as they don't really use them to fly.  It's
the sheer magical nature of a pixie that gives it it's special qualities.

They are a race of very small size, and because of their inquisitive
nature and mental power, tend also to be tinkerers and sometimes
pranksters.  While a pixie may be thousands of years old, almost all
of them act like human children...
~
-1 HALFLING HALFLINGS~

Halflings are a quiet folk who like to keep to themselves, and are not
often seen filling the role of an adventurer.  They would much rather
sit complacently by a fireplace enjoying a good book, good drink, and
good conversation.  They are, however, very adept thieves, and have the
mental capabilities to be quite powerful mages.  They are about half
as tall as the average human, thus the name halfling.  Because of this
small size and the fact that most devices are built to human proportions,
halflings are masters at lockpicking, disarming traps, and jewel craft.
They also have very easy access to pockets, and there is no door a
halfling can not open and slip through with the utmost of silence.
~
-1 HALFORC HALFORCS~

Halforcs are a cross between humans and orcs, dwarves and orcs, or sometimes
even giants and orcs.  These various combinations are almost always the result
of an orc raid on the habitation of one of those other races, and each type of
halforc is just as mean and hearty as the other.  They are also very agile,
and born athletes, however seldom is a halforc found that can even read or
speak coherently.  They are quite literally dumber than bricks, but there is
no more fearsome fighter around.

A halforc is a warrior, and if a halforc is not a warrior, then that halforc
is useless.  They can fight, and when it suits them they can also sleep, eat,
and fornicate, but that's it.
~
-1 GOBLIN GOBLINS~

Goblins are almost universally shunned because they are almost all natural
criminals, cutthroats, and killers.  Every crime boss or thief master is a
goblin, with very few exceptions.  They are extremely thrifty, known to
argue over a single silver piece, and will drop water in the desert before
dropping money. Goblins have diabolical minds, and few torture devices can
be named which a goblin did not think up.  They are extremely smart and also
have a knack for survival.  Stealth comes naturally to them, and their dusky
grey to green, sometimes even blue or black, skin tones make them hard to
spot at night.

Goblins are not really warlike, and don't really appreciate overt combat.
It's not their style.  A goblin would much rather satisfy its sadistic needs
through thievery or betrayal than through honorable combat.
~
-1 HALFELF HALFELVES~

Halfelves are a cross between a human and an elf, usually due to the fact
that human armies sometime make raids on elf lands. Halfelves are very
nearly human, although they tend to be a bit more thoughtful, and less
physically powerful.  Unfortunately they are also more bitter, and much
more aloof than either the most secretive elf or the most secluded human
hermit.  They see themselves as unwelcome in either elf or human society
and as a result tend to lead solitary lives as wandering adventurers who
follow no real creed.

A halfelf is a natural loner, and most of them are rangers or druids,
communing with the nature that they love much as the elves do.
They have much better eyesight than humans, due to their elven ancestry,
but unlike elves are more inquisitive about the world around them, much
as humans are.  
~
-1 AVIAN AVIANS~

The avian race is a very secretive and mysterious one.  They are the size
of giants, towering over any human, but weigh about the same as an elf.
Their slight bone structure allows their wings to carry them as they fly
from place to place, but it also requires them to rely on mental prowess
instead of brawn for survival. Many speculate that they are a people who
evolved in the mountains, perhaps magically.  However they came to be,
they are fiercely religious, and worship a nature diety.  Most choose to
become druids since that allows them to be closest to their god, however
they do well in clerical magicks as well.  They have uncanny powers of
sight, and it is said that an avian can see everything you do. For this
reason many avians are hired as watchkeepers, and they make wonderful
explorers and missionaries.  Their amazingly unusual bodies, which
basically look like emaciated humans with wings, and the fact that they
are used to an isolated environment, makes them very susceptible to
disease and poison.  Many an avian has ventured out of his or her
homeland only to fall victim to one of the many plagues that ravage the
world at large.
~
-1 GNOME GNOMES~

Gnomes are to dwarves what pixies are to elves.  That is to say, they are
smaller, smarter, less-strong cousins.  Where dwarves are known for their
mental dullness but great wisdom, gnomes are known for quick minds and a
very analytical nature.  They are nowhere near as strong or hearty as
dwarves are, but are much the same, being creatures of earth who can't
swim (and thus drown easily like dwarves) and have eyes attuned to seeing
in the dark.  Where a dwarf would see a mine shaft and it's glittering
jewels, though, a gnome notices the girders and struts and supports within
the mine and contemplates ways to make them better.  Gnomes love technology,
metallurgy, and any other form of science.  This makes them natural mages,
possessing mental powers that rival elves.  They are not, however, a stealthy
race like elves, goblins, or halflings.  They are engineers, architects,
artisans, and sometimes workers of great magicks.
~
-1 DRACONIAN DRACONIANS~

The draconians are a fearsome race, and almost as secretive as the avians.
Like the avians, they can fly, and come from some not-so-well-known place
far away.  Unlike any other race though, draconians are not mammalian.
They more closely resemble lizards, snakes, and especially dragons.
They tower over even giants in size, reaching over 12 feet in height, with
leathery wings that can stretch to over 30 feet when extended, and can fold
up neatly on the back, causing no real hindrance in movement.  The sheer
size of a draconian DOES, however, cause problems, because most things in
the world are built with human size in mind.  Draconians are very strong,
and tougher even than dwarves.  Unlike most races that reach such large
proportions, they retain a keen mind, and make good mages as well as
warriors.  Because of their strange biology, and some degree of reptilian
nature, draconians are immune to almost all poisons and plagues.
~
-1 CENTAUR CENTAURS~

Centaurs are woodland beings who shun the company of men.  They dwell in
remote, secluded glades and pastures.  The appearance of a centaur is
unmistakable: they have the upper torso, arms, and head of a human being,
and the lower body of a large, powerful horse.
~
-1 GNOLL GNOLLS~

Gnolls are large, evil, hyena-like humanoids that roam about in loosely
organized bands.  While the body of a gnoll is shaped like that of a human,
the details are those of a hyena.  They stand erect on two legs and have
greenish grey skin, darker near muzzle, with a short reddish grey to dull
yellow mane.
~
-1 HEUCUVA HEUCUVAS~

The heucuva is an undead spirit similar in appearance to a skeleton, but
more dangerous and more difficult to dispel.  The heucuva appears to be
a humanoid skeleton of normal size.  The bones are covered by a robe that
is little more than tattered rags.
~
-1 KENKU KENKUS~

Kenku are bipedal, humanoid birds that use their powers to annoy and
convience the humand and demihuman races.  The typical kenku resembles
a humanoid hawk wearing human clothing.  Kenku have both arms and wings.
The wings are usually folded across the back and may be mistaken at a
distance for a very large backpack.  Height ranges from 5 to 7 feet.
The feathers are predominantly brown with white underfeathers and face
markings.  The eyes are a brilliant yellow.
~
-1 MINOTAUR MINOTAURS~

Minotaurs are either cursed humans or the offspring of minotaurs and
humans.  They usually dwell in underground labyrinths, for they are not
confused in these places, which gives them an advantage over their prey.
Minotaurs are huge, well over 7 feet tall, and quite broad and muscular.
They have the head of a bull but the body of a human male.  Their fur is
brown to black while their body colouring varies as would a normal normal
human's.  Clothing is minimal, usually a loin cloth or skirt.
~
-1 SATYR SATYRS~

Also called fauns, satyrs are a pleasure loving race of half-human, half-goat
creatures.  They symbolize nature's carefree ways.  Satyrs have the torso,
head, and arms of a man, and the hind legs of a goat.  The human head is
surmounted by two sharp horns that poke through the satyr's coarse, curly
hair.  The skin of the upper body ranges from tan to light brown, with rare
individuals (1%) with red skin.  A satyr's hair is medium reddish, or dark
brown.  The horns and hooves are black.  Satyrs living near centaurs are
likely to be friendly with them.
~
-1 TITAN TITANS~

Titans are gargantuan, almost godlike men and women.  They, quite simply,
look like 25 foot tall people of great physical strength and beauty.  They
are commonly dressed in traditional Greek garb, favoring togas, loincloths,
and such.  They wear rare and valuable jewelry and in other ways make
themselves seem beautiful and overpowering.  Titans are very close to nature.
~
-1 WANDS STAVES SCROLLS~

Magical items require training to use properly.  If your character lacks the
necessary skill to use an item, he will fail, possibly destroying it.  The
item skills are as follows:

scrolls		The reading of magical scrolls and books (see 'help recite')
staves		The use of staves and similar devices (see 'help brandish')
wands		The use of wands and similar items (see 'help zap') 
~
-1 'GROUP HEADER'~

The following skills and groups are available to your chacter:
(this list may be seen again by typing list)
~
-1 'GROUP HELP'~

The following commands are available:
list         display all groups and skills not yet bought
learned      show all groups and skills bought 
premise      brief explanation of creation points and skill groups
add <name>   buy a skill or group
drop <name>  discard a skill or group
info <name>  list the skills or spells contained within a group
help <name>  help on skills and groups, or other help topics
done	     exit the character generation process
~
-1 'MENU CHOICE'~

Choice (add,drop,list,help)?~
-1 'GROUPS' 'INFO' 'PREMISE'~

The ROT skill system allows you to fully customize your new character, making
him or her skilled in the skills you choose.  But beware, the skills you pick
at character creation are the only skills you will ever learn.  Skills are 
paid for with creation points, and the more creation points you have, the
harder it is to gain a level.  Furthermore, higher-cost skills are harder to
practice.

Skill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or spells
that are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.  There is a 
default skill group for each class, which can be selected for a balanced 
selection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.

The experience breakdown is as follows: 
points   exp/level     points   exp/level
40        1000         90        6000
50        1500         100       8000
60	  2000         110      12000
70        3000         120      16000 
80        4000         130      24000
The table continues in a similar manner for higher point totals.
~
-1 'CLASS'~

Syntax:  class
         class all
         class <group>

Typing class by itself will list all spell groups that you currently have.
The [class all] format will list all groups that are available to your
particular class.  The [class <group>] method will list all of the spells
available to your class within that group, along with the level at which
you recieve the spell.
~
-1 BASICS 'ROT BASICS'~

The basic skills:

Every character starts with two skill groups, one for their class and a default
set that all characters receive.  The default skills are:

recall  	essential escape skill (see help recall)
scrolls		reading of scrolls and other magical volumes
staves		use of magical staves
wands		use of magical wands

for class defaults, check the classes themselves.
~
-1 MAGE 'MAGIC-USER' 'MAGE BASICS' 'MAGE DEFAULT'~

Mages specialize in the casting of spells, offensive ones in particular.
Mages have the highest-powered magic of any class, and are the only classes
able to use the draconian and enchanting spell groups.  They are also very
skilled at the use of magical items, though their combat skills are the 
weakest of any class.

All mages have the power to levitate a shield in front of them, freeing
both hands for weapons.

All mages begin with skill in the dagger. Any other weapon skills must be
purchased, at a very high rate.  The default skill selection for mages is
as follows:

skills:
lore		the lore of magical items

spell groups:
beguiling	spells that control the mind
combat		offensive magics, such as fireball and chill touch
detection	informational magics, such as detect magic and identify

maladictions	a selection of curses fit for any witch
protective	defensive magics, ranging from armor to stone skin
transporation	spells for getting from here to there
weather		spells for conjuring and mastering the elements
~
-1 CLERIC 'CLERIC BASICS' 'CLERIC DEFAULT'~

Clerics are the most defensively orientated of all the classes.  Most of their
spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat spells
being far less powerful than those of mages. However, clerics are the best 
class by far at healing magics, and they posess an impressive area of
protective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.

Clerics recieve the power to levitate a shield in front of them once they
reach level 50, freeing both hands for weapons.

All clerics begin with skill in the mace.  Other weapon or shield skills must
be purchased, many at a very dear cost.  The default skill selection for 
clerics is as follows:

skills:
flail		the proper use of flails

spell groups:
attack		a selection of offensive magics
creation	the making of physical objects, such as food and water
curative	spells that cure the sick and feeble of their ailments
benedictions	powerful magics that grant the blessings of the gods
detection	informational magics, such as detect magic and identify
healing		spells for treating wounds, from scratches to death blows
maladictions	an assortment of curses
protective	defensive magics, including the powerful sanctuary spell
transportation	spells for getting from here to there
weather         spells for conjuring and mastering the elements
~
-1 THIEF 'THIEF BASICS' 'THIEF DEFAULT'~

Thieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other class,
but have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are specialists at
thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas undetected where
more powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are better fighters than
clerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors.

All thieves begin with the dagger combat skill, and are learned in steal as 
well.  Any other weapon skills must be purchased, unless the default selection
is chosen.  This default skill package includes:

skills:
mace		the use of maces and other blunt weapons
sword		swordplay and fencing
backstab	the art of hitting your opponent by surprise
disarm		used to deprive your opponent of his weapon
dodge		the best way to take a punch is not to be there
second attack	with training, the skilled thief can hit twice as fast
trip		a good way to introduce an opponent to the floor
hide		the art of remaining undetected in a room
peek		used to look into a person's belongings
pick lock	a useful skill for breaking and entering
sneak		with this skill, a thief can walk into a room undetected
~
-1 WARRIOR 'WARRIOR BASICS' 'WARRIOR DEFAULT'~

Warriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters
of all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical
talents of mages and priests.  Warriors are best for those who don't mind
taking the direct approach, even when another method might be called for.

Warriors begin with skill in the sword, and gain a second attack in combat.
Other weapon skills may be purchased cheaply, or gained in the default skill
package, which includes the following:

skills:
weaponsmaster	this group provides knowledge of all weapon types
shield block	the art of parrying with a shield
bash		a forceful rush with the body, designed to flatten your foes
enhanced damage	this skill multiplies your damage in battle
parry		the art of parrying with weapons
rescue		allows you to take the blows aimed for a companion
third attack	allows the skilled warrior to land three blows in one round
~
-1 RANGER 'RANGER BASICS' 'RANGER DEFAULT'~

Rangers are travelling warrior-druids, usually solitary and aloof.  They
are often the protectors of those far from home, travellers who are lost,
or even bounty hunters who track criminals in order to bring them to
justice or just to make a buck.  They are sometimes used as scouts for
armies, and sometimes make up their own force in times of war.

Rangers don't have the pure combat effectiveness of warriors, and lack
the total control of druidic magic that druids possess, but the combination
of those disciplines makes them a class to be reckoned with.

skills:
backstab        the art of hitting your opponent by surprise
enhanced damage this skill multiplies your damage in battle
parry           the art of parrying with weapons
shield block    the art of parrying with a shield
weaponsmaster   this group provides knowledge of all weapon types

spell groups:
curative        spells that cure the sick and feeble of their ailments
healing         spells for treating wounds, from scratches to death blows
transportation  spells for getting from here to there
weather         spells for conjuring and mastering the elements
~
-1 DRUID 'DRUID BASICS' 'DRUID DEFAULT'~

Druids are the protectors of nature.  Some spend their lives in forests,
others in deserts, and some still in seas or mountainous regions.  Where
a druid can be closer to nature and life than to the constructs of mortals,
that druid can be happy.

They control a very powerful blend of magic, potent healing spells with
devastating combat spells, but they don't have transportation spells, as
druids are not wont to travel.  They aren't always well suited for it.

skills:
lore            the lore of magical items
second attack   with training, the skilled druid can hit twice as fast
shield block    the art of parrying with a shield
sneak           with this skill, a druid can walk into a room undetected

spell groups:
attack          a selection of offensive magics
benedictions    powerful magics that grant the blessings of the gods
creation        the making of physical objects, such as food and water
curative        spells that cure the sick and feeble of their ailments
healing         spells for treating wounds, from scratches to death blows
protective      defensive magics, including the powerful sanctuary spell
weather         spells for conjuring and mastering the elements
~
-1 VAMPIRE 'VAMPIRE BASICS' 'VAMPIRE DEFAULT'~

Vampires are killers.  They aren't truly alive in the sense that most
mortals are, but are rather undead, not really subject to whithering of
old age or the fading of the mind that those who are truly alive find
themselves subject to.  As a result vampires are long lived, and almost
all of them eventually go insane.  They are very much like thieves, but
possess very potent powers of magic.

Vampires are not really a class in the traditional since, as many don't
choose to be what they are, and their powers are not the result of education
and training, but of undead nature.

skills:
backstab        the art of hitting your opponent by surprise
disarm          used to deprive your opponent of his weapon
dodge           the best way to take a punch is not to be there
shield block    the art of parrying with a shield
sneak           with this skill, a vampire can walk into a room undetected

spell groups:
beguiling       spells that control the mind
detection       informational magics, such as detect magic and identify
enhancement     spells that maximize physical potential, such as haste
illusion        magics for concealing and deceiving
maladictions    a selection of curses fit for any witch
transportation  spells for getting from here to there

~
-1 EXOTIC WEAPONS WEAPON WEAPONSMASTER AXE DAGGER FLAIL MACE POLEARM SPEAR SWORD WHIP~

Each weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines how
well a character fights with a particular weapon.  The weaponsmaster group
provides talent in all weapons (save exotics), from chair legs to halberds.
If the character has the parry skill as well, he can parry incoming attacks.
The chance of parrying is best if the character in question is skilled at 
both his weapon and his opponent's.

The weapon skills consist of the following:

weaponsmaster	skill group of all weapons listed below (save exotic weaponry)
axe		the use of axes, ranging from hand to great (but not halberds)
dagger		the use of knives and daggers, and other stabbing weapons
flail		skill in ball-and-chain type weapons
mace		this skill includes clubs and hammers as well as maces
polearm		the use of pole weapons (except spears), including halberds
spear		this skill covers both spears and staves, but not polearms
sword		the warrior's standby, from rapier to claymore
whip		the use of whips, chains, and bullwhips
exotic		the use of strange magical weapons

The exotic skill cannot be purchased, and is dependent solely upon level.
~
-1 TRANSPORT~

Syntax: cast transport <object> <char>

This spell will transport an obj from your inventory to the inventory of
another player.  You can turn off the ability to recieve transports using
the notran command.
~
-1 'SHIELD BLOCK'~

Shield block is a rather fancy name for the art of parrying with a shield.
Characters with no shield block skill will not be able to defend themselves
well with a shield.  All classes may learn shield block, but only warriors and
clerics are good at it.  Beware, flails ignore shield blocking attempts, and
whips have an easier time getting around them.  Axes may split shields in two.
~
-1 ATTACK~

The attack spells are essentially powerful curses, fueled by divine energy
rather than magical power (like the combat spells are). They are less powerful
than the combat spells, but can still deal out a stinging blow.  Mages and 
thieves cannot use this group.  The attack spell group consists of the 
following spells:

demonfire	a powerful, but very evil, spell
dispel evil	torments evil foes
dispel good	calls down unholy power on good creatures
earthquake	brings the power of earth to bear against your foes
flamestrike	sends a column of flame from the heavens
heat metal	heats metal equipment to searing temperatures
ray of truth	sends forth a blinding ray of holy energy
~
-1 BEGUILING~

This insideous spell group is used to invade the minds of others.  It consists
of various charming magics, well suited for turning your foes to your cause.
Only mages and thieves have access to the beguiling magics, which consist of
the following:

animate		gives life to severed body parts
calm            if successful, stops all fighting in the room
charm person	turns an enemy into a trusted friend
resurrect	resurrects corpses, making them your pet
sleep		puts a foe into enchanted slumber
~
-1 BENEDICTIONS~

Benedictions are priestly spells, used to bestow divine favor upon your allies.
They are often restricted to those of like alignment.  Only clerics and 
warriors may use these spells.  The benedictions spell group consists of the
following:

bless		bestows divine favor upon the target
calm		if successful, stops all fighting in the room
frenzy		puts the recipient into beserker rage
holy word	aids your allies while calling divine wrath upon your foes
remove curse	removes malevolent magic from players and items
~
-1 COMBAT~

These sorcerous spells are, in the words of one famous mage, just 'more ways to
toss energy around'.  They are the most powerful of the damaging spells, and
considered an essential part of most wizards' collections. Clerics and thieves
do not have access to these spells.  In order of power, the combat spell group
contains the following magics:

magic missile	send a weak energy bolt into a foe
chill touch	weakens your enemy with a frigid grasp
burning hands	sends a blast of fire into your foe
shocking grasp	sends a powerful jolt into a foe
lightning bolt	sends forth a single bolt of lightning into an enemy
colour spray	blasts your opponent with a rainbow spray, which may blind him
fireball	a powerful spell, great for burning your enemy to ashes
acid blast	sends forth a stream of acid to eradicate your foes
chain lightning	sends lightning bolts arcing through foes 
~
-1 CREATION~

The creation spell group is used to create objects, of temporary or permanent
duration.  Skill creators can travel without food or drink, and use their 
powers to create nourishment as required.  All classes may become learned in
this group, which contains these spells:

continual light	creates an eternal light source
create food	produces a nourishing mushroom
create rose	creates a beautiful red rose
create spring	calls forth a small but pure spring from the ground
create water	fills any available container with water
empower		creates a scroll or potion containing a spell
floating disc	creates a floating disc of force perfect for hauling treasure
~
-1 CURATIVE~

The curative spells are used to heal various unpleasant conditions that can
befall an adventurer.   For healing of damage, see the healing spell group.
Curative spells cannot be used by mages or thieves.

cure blindness	restored sight to the blind
cure disease	heals the plague
cure poison	removes the harmful effects of poison
~
-1 DETECTION~

The detection spells have may uses, all related to gathering information. They
can be used to see hidden objects, give information about treasure, or even
scry out the true nature of your foe.  All classes except warriors can use 
detection spells.

detect evil	reveals the aura of evil monsters
detect good	similar to above, only for good monsters
detect hidden	shows the whereabouts of hidden foes
detect invis	allows the caster to see the unseeable

farsight	searches for living beings near the caster
identify	gives information about the nature of an object
know alignment	determines the moral character of a monster or person
locate object	finds a specific item
~
-1 DRACONIAN~

The Draconian spell group deals with the magic of dragons -- in this case, 
bringing forth the devastating power of their breath weapons upon your foes.
Only mages have the mental training necessary to cast these spells, and few
of them ever reach the level of mastery required to use them.

acid breath	 uses the black dragon's attack upon an enemy
fire breath	 calls forth the flames of a red dragon
frost breath	 drains the life from a foe with the power a white dragon
gas breath	 suffocates your enemies with poison gas
lightning breath summons the electrical fury of a blue dragon 
~
-1 ENCHANTMENT~

The enchantment spell group is used to imbue items with magical properties.
Currently, this spell group consists of enchant weapon and enchant armor, 
although more will be added in the future.  Only mages may enchant.

enchant weapon	increases the hit and damage bonuses of a weapon
enchant armor	increases the protective value of armor
fireproof       shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid
recharge	restores power to a depleted wand or staff
~
-1 ENHANCEMENT~

The enhancement spells improve upon the body's potential, allowing feats of
superhuman strength and speed.  However, these spells may often have harmful
effects upon the recipient.

giant strength	grants increased strength
haste		doubles the speed of the target, but slows down healing
infravision	allows monsters to be seen in the dark
refresh		restores energy to tired adventurers
~
-1 HARMFUL~

This spell group is the opposite of healing.  The harmful spells are designed
to tear flesh from bone, rupture arteries, and generally turn the body against
itself.  Only priests and warriors may use this spell group.
In order of power, the harmful spells are:

cause light	inflicts minor wounds on an enemy
cause serious	inflicts wounds on a foe
cause critical  causes major damage to the target
harm		the most deadly harmful spell
~
-1 HEALING~

The healing spells are used to cure the wounds that adventurers inevitably
suffer in battle.  For curing other conditions, such as poison, see the
curative spell group.  Only warriors and priests have access to this group.
In order of power, the healing spells are:

cure light	heals minor wounds
refresh		restores vigor to a tired adventurer
cure serious	heals wounds
cure critical	closes all but the worst wounds
heal		the most powerful healing spell
mass healing	casts a heal spell on each player in the room
~
-1 ILLUSION~

The illusions spells are dedicated to deception and trickery.  They can be
used to mask appearances, or create distractions for the party.  Currently,
the illusion group is very small, but it will be expanded in the future.
Only thieves and mages can cast illusion spells, which consist of the 
following:

invis		turns the target invisible
mass invis	turns the caster's group invisible
ventriloquate	allows the caster to put words in someone's mouth
~
-1 MALADICTIONS~

Maladictions are a group of curses and other baneful spells, designed to
cripple, inconvenience, or torture, rather than kill outright.  These spells
may be cast by any class.

blindess	strikes the target blind
curse		prevents recalling and weakens the target in combat
energy drain	drains experience and mana, while strengthening the caster
plague		causes the target to suffer a slow, painful death from plague
poison		weaker than plague, but often fatal
slow		slows your enemies down, reducing their rate of attack	
weaken		drains the strength of the target
~
-1 PROTECTIVE~

The protective spells are used to shield against harm, whether from spells or
physical attack.  They range from the weak armor spell to the sought-after
sanctuary charm.  Also included in this group are several spells for dispeling
hostile magics. Any class may use this group, which consists of the following 
spells:

armor		provides the target with an extra layer of defense
cancellation	a powerful dispel, used for removing spells from friends

~
-1 SHIELDING FIRESHIELD ICESHIELD SHOCKSHIELD ACIDSHIELD GLASSSHEILD WATERSHIELD HOLYSHIELD~

These arcane and costly spells are only for the most learned of the ranks of
mages and clerics wandering the land.  They require great amounts of energy
and can be very devastating.  The following spells are included in this
group and are listed in order of strength:

        iceshield       surrounds target with a thick shell of ice
        fireshield      surrounds target with a flaming inferno

Questions and comments can be sent to micah@cse.unl.edu.
New shields coded by Firehed -- Firehed13@hotmail.com
~
-1 TRANSPORTATION~

The transportation group is used for travel, whether by flight, magical
teleportation, or walking through walls.  All classes may learn these spells,
which are among the most useful in the game.

fly		allows the target to fly over nearly all obstacles
gate		transports the caster to the target
nexus		forms a two-way portal to a far off destination
pass door	allows the caster to walk through walls
portal		creates a one-way portal to a destination
summon		transports the target to the caster
teleport	sends the target to a random location
transport	sends the target object to another player
word of recall	transports the caster to safety in Midgaard
~
-1 WEATHER~

These spells allow the caster to manipulate local weather conditions, as well
as summon fog clouds, lightning, or even electrical glows.  This group is
usable by all classes.

call lightning	summons a huge bolt from the heavens, if the weather is right
control weather	changes the weather in the manner desired by the caster
faerie fire	surrounds the target in a glowing aura
faerie fog	reveals all hidden creatures in the room
lightning bolt	sends a bolt of electricity into the target

(the weather command, unrelated to this group, shows local weather conditions)
~
-1 BACKSTAB~

Backstab is the favored attack of  thieves, murderers, and other rogues.  It 
can be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing weapons.
The damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker's level, his
weapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of his opponent.
Only thieves may learn the backstab.
~
-1 BASH~

The bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock
your foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the
bash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon
is not generally a wise idea.
~
-1 BERSERK~

Only powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage
in combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge
surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  
Berserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.
~
-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~

Consider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever 
combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The
blindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity
helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  Only warriors and thieves may
learn this skill.
~
-1 DISARM~

Disarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your
opponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you
are skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon. Only talented thieves
and warriors may learn this skill.
~
-1 DODGE~

In the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not
be where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the
character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the 
target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the
attacker and the target.  Any class may learn dodging.
~
-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~

Warriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that they are
able to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked
for with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus
is very low indeed.
~
-1 ENVENOM~

The envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves, designed to
win a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.
Or, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.
Food, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned
food or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to
be more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could
drink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on
the other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison 
burns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates 
quickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.
~
-1 'HAND TO HAND'~

Hand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning this
style of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.
Trained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.
Clerics and warriors are the best at this skill, although thieves and mages
may also learn it.
~
-1 KICK~

Kicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful
kick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.  Fighters
and clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although thieves may also learn
it.
~
-1 PARRY~

If at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting 
attacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for
full success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced
damage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the
defender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.
~
-1 RESCUE~

A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with
the rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede
in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the
favor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as
well as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and
the target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)
~
-1 TRIP~

Back by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves
using any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.
Tripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will
find the attack easy to avoid.  Thieves and warriors may learn trip.
~
-1 'SECOND ATTACK'~

Training in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes
in combat -- allow a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every
round.  Any class may learn this skill, although clerics and mages have a 
very hard time with it.
~
-1 'THIRD ATTACK'~

Training in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike
in a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.  Perfect
third attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.  Only warriors, rangers,
and highly skilled thieves may learn this skill.
~
-1 'FOURTH ATTACK'~

Training in fourth attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike
in a combat, and increases the chance of a third attack as well.  Perfect
fourth attack does NOT assure four attacks per round.  Only warriors, rangers,
and highly skilled thieves may learn this skill.
~
-1 'FIFTH ATTACK'~

Training in fifth attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike
in a combat, and increases the chance of a fourth attack as well.  Perfect
fifth attack does NOT assure five attacks per round.  Only warriors and highly
skilled rangers may learn this skill.
~
-1 HIDE SNEAK~

Hide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.
Hide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the
character remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to
sneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  Only warriors and
thieves may learn these skills.
~
-1 'FAST HEALING'~

The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,
or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general 
toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is 
possible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but mages find it
very difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.
~
-1 LORE~

Lore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use
of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,
concerning its power and uses.  It also may occasionally increase the value
of an object, because more will be known about its worth.  All classes may
learn lore, although thieves are best at it, and warriors find it very hard
to use.
~
-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~

Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to
match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,
or to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are 
already very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best 
guard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling, 
although other classes may learn it as well.
~
0 PEEK~

Peek is both a skill and a command.

The peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,
the better to use the steal command with.

Syntax: peek <char>
This will attempt to peek at a characters inventory, you may also make
this automatic during a: look <char>  by turning on AUTOPEEK.
~
-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~

Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain
access to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  
intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may
learn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.
~
-1 MEDITATION~

This skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and
mantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.
Thieves and warriors, with their troubled minds and violent attitudes, have
much trouble learning to meditate.
~
-1 STEAL~

Theft is the defining skill of the thief, and is only available to that class.
It allows items to be stolen from the inventory of monsters and characters,
and even from shops!  But beware, shop keepers gaurd their merchandise 
carefully, and attempting to steal from a character earns you a THIEF flag
if you are caught (making you free game for killing).
~
-1 'DETECT GOOD'~

Syntax: cast 'detect good'
 
This spell enables the caster to detect good characters, which will
reveal a characteristic golden aura.
~
-1 'DISPEL GOOD'~

Syntax: cast 'dispel good' <victim>
 
This spell invokes the wrath of Belan on a good victim. It can be very
dangerous for casters who are pure of heart.
~
-1 'RECHARGE'~

Syntax: cast 'recharge' <item>

The recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.
Fully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell
is proportional to the number of charges used.  Magic items can only be
recharged one time successfully.
~
-1 'DEMONFIRE'~

Syntax: cast 'demonfire' <target>

Demonfire is a spell of blackest evil, and as such can only be used by those
who follow the paths of darkness.  It conjures forth demonic spirits to 
inflict terrible wounds on the enemies of the caster.
~
-1 'RAY OF TRUTH'~

Syntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target>

Ray of truth opens a portal to the planes of positive energy, bringing forth
a beam of light of sufficient purity to harm or or annihilate the servants
of evil.  It cannot harm the pure of heart, and will turn and strike 
casters who are tainted by evil.
~
-1 'PORTAL'~

Syntax: cast 'portal' <target>

The portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal
to the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are
entered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'go portal'.  Portals cannot
be made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.
Portal requires a special source of power to be used, unfortunately the
secret of this material component has been lost...
~
-1 'NEXUS'~

Syntax: cast 'nexus' <target>

This spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with the
only difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus 
spell makes a two-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered
portal spell.  Both spells require an additional power source, the secret
of which has been lost...
~
-1 'HEAT METAL'~

Syntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>

Heat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary 
according to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment
(assumed to be all weapons and armor at this point in time) on the target,
causing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the
process (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily).
This spell does no damage to creatures who are immune to fire.
~
-1 'HOLY WORD'~

Syntax: cast 'holy word'

Holy word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god, with
disasterous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with powerful
blessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like alignment in the
room are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath, while those of
opposite morals (or both good and evil in the case of neutral priests)
are struck down by holy (or unholy might) and cursed.  The cleric suffers
greatly from the strain of this spell, being left unable to move and 
drained of vitality.  Experience loss is no longer associated with the spell.
~
-1 FRENZY~

Syntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>

The frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing
his or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine
wrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety, 
making the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm
spell (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's 
alignment.
~
-1 CALM~

Syntax: cast 'calm' 

One of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master cleric is
the calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed
creatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage
in combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violence 
activity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing --
either all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who
are immune to magic) or none is.
~
-1 HASTE~

Syntax: cast 'haste' <target>

The haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing
an extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive
abilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the system,
such that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating
the slow spell. (see 'help slow').
~
-1 SLOW~

Syntax: cast 'slow' <target>

Despite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell
with it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,
it slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate
of attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and halve healing
rates, due to reduced metabolism.
~
-1 PLAGUE~

Syntax: cast 'plague' <target>

The plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,
sapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to
death.  It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like
wildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area.
~
-1 'CREATE ROSE'~

Syntax: cast 'create rose'

A romantic spell that creates a fragrant red rose, with utterly no game
use whatsoever.
~
-1 'PROTECTION GOOD' 'PROTECTION EVIL'~

Syntax: cast 'protection evil' <target>
	cast 'protection good' <target>

The protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate
ethos, and improve saving throws against all forms of magic. They may not
be cast on others, and one person cannot carry both defenses at the same
time.
~
0 'GIANT STRENGTH'~

Syntax: cast 'giant strength' <character>
 
This spell increases the strength of the target character.
~
-1 'CHAIN LIGHTNING'~

Syntax : cast 'chain lightning' <target>

Chain lightning is a deadly spell, producing a powerful bolt of lightning
that arcs from target to target in the room, until its force is fully
expended.  Allies of the caster may be hit by this spell if they are members 
of a clan, while the caster himself will not be struck unless no other
viable target remains.  Chain lightning is most effective when used on
groups of creatures.
~
-1 SCAN FARSIGHT~

scan farsight
Syntax: scan
	scan <direction>
	cast 'farsight'

The scan command allows the user to detect movement in surrounding areas.

The farsight spell expands the caster's consciousness, allowing him or her
to see far away beings like they were in the same room.  It takes intense
concentration, often leaving the caster helpless for several minutes.
The spell may be used for a general scan that reaches a short distance in
all directions, or with a directional component to see creatures much
farther away.
~
-1 MASS HEALING~

Syntax: cast 'mass healing' 

The mass healing spell, as its name might suggest, performs a healing spell
on all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell for good
measure.
~
-1 'FLOATING DISC'~

Syntax: cast 'floating disc'

This useful spell creates a floating field of force which follows the caster
around, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear of weight
penalties.  It lasts no more than twice the casters level in hours, and
usually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per level of the caster, with a 
maximum of five pounds per item.  The spell requires an open float location
on the character, and the only way to remove the disc is to die or allow it
to run out of energy.
~
-1 FIREPROOF~

Syntax: cast 'fireproof' <object>

The fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,
to protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected
by this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.
Although inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical
for protecting large numbers of objects.
~
-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~

Syntax: alias
	alias <word>
	alias <word> <substitution>
	unalias <word>

The alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,
aliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command.
Alias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the alias with 
that name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and argument 
produces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new
command.  Examples of use:

alias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing 'get all corpse'
alias ff cast 'fireball' --> ff orc will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc'

Only the first word on the line will be subsituted at this time.
~
-1 OLC EDIT~

Syntax: EDIT AREA [create/reset] [vnum]		- Area Creation and Repoping.
Syntax: EDIT ROOM ( [create] [vnum] )		- Room Creation and Editing.
Syntax: EDIT OBJ  [create] <vnum>		- Object Creation and Editing.

It was then converted to work with Envy by Jason Dinkel, and ported to ROM
2.3 by Hans Birkeland (Hugin). Port to Rom 2.4 by Ivan Toledo (ver 1.5a).

     Inside an editor, typing COMMANDS lists working commands and ? gives
help. AEDIT and REDIT default to the current area or room. EDIT ROOM RESET
resets the current room.  Most commands with no arguments display syntax.

The values in parenthesis are the the standard merc values.
~
0 MANADICE~

A high number of dice makes for less variance in mobiles mana.

0 RESETS~

Syntax: RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> <location on body>    - equips last mobile
        RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> inside <obj vnum>     - store in container
        RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> room                  - store in room
        RESET <number> MOB <vnum> [<max #>]             - load a mobile
        RESET <number> DELETE                           - delete a reset

RESET alone will display the resets in the current room.  The <number> will
be displayed with this list.  Typing ? WEAR-LOC will list possible locations
that an object can be loaded to.  The [<max #>] is the maximum number of
mobiles allowed in this room and will default to 1 if no number is entered.

For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical order.
For example if you are equiping a mobile don't load a container in the room
and fill it with some objects and then continue equiping the mobile.  It is
likely that resets will backfire if they are not carefully entered.

If you wish to reset the room then use EDIT ROOM RESET.
